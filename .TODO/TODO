* Nikola for publication of multi-format doconce documents
  (say for a course), with optional blog comments.
  URL: "http://getnikola.com/handbook.html".
  Possible to allow for MathJax and pretty code in blog parts?

* Collapsing regions in HTML (e.g., solutions in exercises):
  Use Bootstrap theme and see "example": "http://jsfiddle.net/Sherbrow/68RXP/".
  Could also be !bexpand-!eexpand.

* `--html_style=Bootstrap`: also allow for !bsidebar-!esidebar, which
  works in HTML only, otherwise typeset as paragraph with optional heading,
  and creates something on the side.
  Could have toc in as a pulldown navigation item in the top bar.

===== From Google Doc to Doconce =====

Export in html, interpret the html (fairly complicated) or use
pandoc to go to latex. Then one needs adjustments:

 * All notes in the Google Doc: `\textsuperscript{\hyperref[.+?]{{[}.{]}}}` must be removed.
 * Remove tildes.
 * One-liners are probably h3 headlines.

Maybe pandoc for going from html to markdown is a better option - yes!
Will also need to remove all the footnotes arising from internal notes.

Going from docx, rtf, odt via pandoc did not work.

===== From Doconce to Google Doc =====

Go to html, upload the html file to Google Drive, and open with Google Doc.
LaTeX math and figures do not work.
