===== Test of tables =====
label{sec:tables}

Here is a table with three columns:

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

===== Aligned equations with labels =====
label{sec:math:align}

Systems of equations with labels are not supported in Markdown, so
notebooks struggle with these. Let's test my treatment of them.

!bt
\begin{align}
ax + b & =0,
label{eq1}\\
x^2 + px + q &= 0.
label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
Most science students are good at solving equations, but few can
handle more than (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}).

===== Mnimalistic test of movies =====
label{sec:movies}

Here is a movie about a wave:

MOVIE: [mov-wavebc/gaussian_Nx50_C1_un0/movie.mp4] Reflecting boundaries ($u_x=0$) for a Gaussian wave.

Figure ref{fig1} displays a plug-shaped wave signal.

We must be able to embed them as well:
