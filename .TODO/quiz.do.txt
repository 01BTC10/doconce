======= Ideas for automatically generating surveys and quizzes =======

=== Problem ===

Given data for surveys and quizzes are available in some format,
typically as text in files or as a Python data structure,
how can we turn that information into live surveys and quizzes in
online forms at Google, Surveymonkey, or Kahoot?

=== Constraints ===

Our questions will frequently contain

 * inline mathematics (LaTeX)
 * equations (LaTeX)
 * inline computer code
 * blocks with computer code (nicely typeset with HTML)
 * images
 * videos
 * text

It is key that the generated surveys/quizzes can represent mathematics
and computer code in a satisfactory way. Ideally, all text can be in
HTML with MathJax. A next best solution is to automatically
generated LaTeX mathematics through a service like
URL: "'http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?", and to rely on HTML
for computer code.

===== Ranking of sites =====

 o JotForm
 o SurveyGizmo
 o Kahoot (great for game, no math and code)
 o Google

===== Suggested Python data structure =====

A survey or quiz can be a list of questions. Each question is a
Python `OrderedDict` (dictionary where the keys have a specific ordering).
Typical keys are

 * `text`: running text in HTML (typically expressing the question)
 * `title`: question title
 * `choices`: (choice 1, choice 2, choice 3, ...)
 * `comments`: (comment 1, comment 2, comment 3, ...) - comments to `choices`
   for explaining why a choice is correct or wrong
 * `answer`: index/indices in `choices` corresponding to correct answer
 * `input`: a free text area with the answer (alternative to `choices`)
 * `interpret-input`: Python function that can read `input` and return
   `True` or `False` if the answer is correct or wrong (will typically
   use some regular expressions to analyze the text)

Headings (pure string) can be inserted in the Python list to
indicate sections of questions, typically corresponding to pages with
a heading in the web form.

Depending on what `text` can contain in the form, it might be necessary to
distinguish between pure text and other elements that require special
typesetting:

 * `video`: (URL of a video, caption, width, height)
 * `image`: (URL of an image, caption, width, height)
 * `equation`: LaTeX
 * `inline-math`: LaTeX
 * `code`: code block
 * `inline-code`: text
 * `points`: no of points for this question

===== Google forms =====

Google Apps Script is Google's variant of JavaScript and it allows
Google forms to be created by a program. Suppose the data for surveys
and quizzes are available as Python objects. A Python function could
them dump the relevant JavaScript code, and this code can then
manually or automatically be uploaded to a Google form.

 * "Example on generating a form in JavaScript": "https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/"

 * "Video on getting mathematics into Google forms": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-kpc8zS-Do" (`urllib.quote` can quote URL calls with arguments, also see URL: "'http://latex.codecogs.com/" for turning LaTeX math into PNG images)
 * "Math in Google forms": "http://news.dessci.com/2013/06/for-quick-math-assessments-use-mathtype-with-google-forms.html" (seems to be an interactive tool...?)

!bwarning
Googling seems to indicate that there is no support for MathJax
in Google forms, which means that mathematics must be turned into
images. This requires inline formulas and equations to be separate
objects in the data structure that holds the survey/quiz.

There is a "technical explanation": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mathjax-users/atsUdCzTB-0" for the above conclusion.


===== SurveyGizmo =====

 * "SurveyGizmo": "http://www.surveygizmo.com" offers "scripting":
   "http://surveygizmoscript.helpgizmo.com/help" and a "REST API":
   "http://apisurveygizmo.helpgizmo.com/help". Generating surveys
   directly from a program seems to be easiest with the REST API, but
   uploading a pure text file defining the survey (see below) is probably
   much easier.
 * It seems that math in SurveyGizmo is limited to using
   "MathType":
   "http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/works_with.asp#!target=surveygizmo" interactively on Windows...maybe it can be automated?
 * One can upload surveys in the form of "pure text or HTML to SurveyGizmo": "http://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-software-features/import-surveys-from-word/". If this supports MathJax and nicely typeset code is an open question. See also "import from Word": "http://surveygizmo.helpgizmo.com/help/article/link/import-from-word".
 * SurveyGizmo is used for "quizzes in teaching": "http://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-blog/customer-innovations-educators-use-online-surveys-for-student-tests-and-quizzes/".

===== JotForm =====

 * Easy "communication via Dropbox": "http://www.jotform.com/dropbox/"
 * Has an  "API": "http://api.jotform.com/docs/".
 * Can "ask questions": "http://api.jotform.com/docs#contact".
 * Has a "Python API": "https://github.com/jotform/jotform-api-python" too.

No MathJax support, but it is planned:

!bc
We don't have any integration option with MathJax at the moment, but a
few months ago, we released "Widgets" platform that helps developers
to integrate new fields with JotForm easily. We have 300+ different
widgets from Image Sliders to YouTube videos in our widgets gallery
now (http://widgets.jotform.com)

MathJax can be integrated with JotForm by using Widgets platform. I
will add MathJax field to our widget requests with high priority but I
can't give a specific date about when it will be ready to use.

After we integrate it, you can easily create forms that includes
MathJax by using JotForm Form Builder or JotForm API.
!ec

Note that they have a lot of widgets to get sound, radio, youtube, whatever
into the Jot forms.


===== Kahoot =====

 * Does not support any HTML or MathJax at all, just plain text.

===== WordPress Quiz Master Next =====

URL: "http://wordpress.org/plugins/quiz-master-next/"
Might be able to "import quizzes": "http://wordpress.org/support/topic/importfunction". WordPress has some limited LaTeX support.

===== Wufoo =====

Lots of "features": "http://www.wufoo.com/features/", including a
"REST API": "http://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/Wufoo-REST-API-V3" and a "Python API": "https://github.com/wufoo/pyfoo".
Here is an example "using Python to create forms and integrate them on a web site": "https://www.wufoo.com/2011/11/14/create-and-grade-quizzes-with-a-little-wufoo-python-and-django/".

===== Classmarker =====

Classmarker seems to have an effective API and aim at exams and quizzes,
see the "API doc": "http://www.classmarker.com/online-testing/api/developers/".

===== Testmoz =====

 * Testmoz has the possibility to have arbitrary HTML code in questions,
   but not in answers, see the "FAQ": "https://testmoz.com/#faqs".
 * Very simple, but no API. Does not work with MathJax.
 * Conclusion after testing : No option.

===== FluidSurvey =====

===== Zoho Survey =====

===== SurveyMonkey =====

This tool "cannot be automated": "http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Can-I-upload-a-survey-created-in-another-file-or-import-responses".

===== Home-made solution with JavaScript =====

 * Have an INF1100 quiz code generator in plain JavaScript that is a
   starting point. No database for recording results, just feedback to
   the student.
 * "Basic example with jQuery": "http://www.hungrypiranha.org/make-a-website/html-quiz" (seems to be a way to go)
 * "jQuery.Survey": "http://flesler.webs.com/jQuery.Survey/", see
   "GitHub repo": "https://github.com/jdarling/jQuery.Survey" for use.
   Seems as a small project.
 * "More info on JavaScript for surveys": "http://www.jensbits.com/2010/01/29/pop-up-survey-with-jquery-ui-dialog/"
 * "Another JavaScript quiz example": "https://www.inkling.com/read/javascript-jquery-david-sawyer-mcfarland-2nd/chapter-3/tutorial-a-simple-quiz"

Can relatively easily combine JavaScript solutions with a database
in Django or Flask. Not exactly sure how this is done without user
login and in a common database...
