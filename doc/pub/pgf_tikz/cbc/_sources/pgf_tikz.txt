A modest beginning
==================

.. _line:

.. figure:: line.png

   This shape is commonly referred to as a *straight line*

Lines such as the one in figure :ref:`line` can be combined to form other shapes.

.. _square:

.. figure:: square.png

   *This square is formed by four straight lines*

A grid can also be made from straight lines.

.. figure:: grid.png

   This is a grid with 5 x 5 cells

A circle, however, cannot be formed by a finite number of straight lines.

.. figure:: circle.png

   This circle is drawn in blue with a dashed line

[**kgh 1**: filenames identical to words in the texts have been known to cause problems]

More advanced figures
=====================

.. figure:: maze.png

   A maze can be drawn by combining the elements above

.. figure:: graph.png

   TikZ is quite well suited to draw graphs

Plotting functions
==================

TikZ can be used to plot functions. The next figure will be inlined.

.. figure:: plot1.png

.. figure:: plot2.png

   The functions can even be labeled!
