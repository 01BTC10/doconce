A modest beginning
==================

.. _line:

.. figure:: line.tikz

   This shape is commonly referred to a *straight line*

Lines such as the one in figure :ref:`line` can be combined to form other shapes.

.. _square:

.. figure:: square.tikz

   *This square is formed by four straight lines*

A grid can also be made from straight lines.

.. figure:: grid.tikz

   This is a grid with 6 x 6 cells

A fig/circle.tikz, however, cannot be formed by a finite number of straight lines.

.. figure:: circle.tikz

   This circle is blue, since blue is a nice colour

More advanced figures
=====================

.. figure:: maze.tikz

   A maze can be drawn by combining the elements above

.. figure:: graph.tikz

   TikZ is quite well suited to draw graphs

Plotting functions
==================

.. figure:: plot1.tikz

   TikZ can be used to plot functions

.. figure:: plot2.tikz

   The functions can even be labeled!
