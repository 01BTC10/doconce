<b>Disclaimer.</b>
Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running <code>doconce format</code>, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself. However, Doconce applies
regular expressions to a large extent for transforming text, and
regular expressions may sometimes fail. Therefore, there is a chance that legal
Doconce syntax is not treated properly.

<h1>General Problems  <a name="___sec0"></a></h1>

<h2>Spellcheck reports a lot of mistakes related to LaTeX math  <a name="___sec1"></a></h2>

The <code>doconce spellcheck</code> command should ignore LaTeX math, but if
the dollar signs for inline math are not correct (one missing, for instance),
a lot of math enters the text to be spellchecked. Invoke the
relevant <code>tmp_missing_*</code> file and find the first math-style expression that
is reported as misspelling. Open the corresponding stripped file,
<code>tmp_stripped_*</code>, which is supposed to have all the math stripped
away, and search for the misspelling. When you find it, you will see
that there are math expressions in the stripped file that should not
be there. (Because of wrong begin and end signs around math expressions
ordinary text has instead been stripped away. This way, a missing dollar
sign can lead to hundreds of misspellings.)
Find the problem in the corresponding Doconce file and correct it.
A similar error can be caused by wrong matching
of equation environments between <code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code>.

<h2>Text between subexercises are moved  <a name="___sec2"></a></h2>

If you insert text between a <code>!esubex</code> and the next <code>!bsubex</code>, this
text is moved before all the subexercises. This is a feature, not a
bug (exercises have certain elements: main text, subexercises, hints,
etc. that are typeset in a specific order, which may be different from
what appears in the Doconce source file). If you need a comment
between two subexercises, just place the comment at the end of the
previous subexercise.

<h2>Doconce aborts because of a syntax error that is not an error  <a name="___sec3"></a></h2>

Doconce searches for typical syntax errors and usually aborts the
execution if errors are found. However, it may happen,
especially in verbatim blocks, that Doconce reports syntax errors
that are not errors. To continue execution, simply add the
<code>--no_abort</code> option on the command line. You may send an email
to the Doconce author at <code>hpl@simula.no</code> and report the problem.

<h2>Figure captions are incomplete  <a name="___sec4"></a></h2>

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as <em>one line</em>, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

<h2>Problems with boldface and emphasize  <a name="___sec5"></a></h2>

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

<h2>Links to local directories do not work  <a name="___sec6"></a></h2>

Links of the type
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>see the &quot;examples directory&quot;: &quot;src/examples&quot;
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>see the &quot;examples directory&quot;: &quot;src/examples/index.html&quot;
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
We recommend to put all files you link to in a <code>_static</code> directory
if you intend to use the <code>sphinx</code> output. This guarantees that all
your files are collected in the Sphinx directory tree bundle.
With plain <code>html</code> output only, you can link to whatever, but remember
to move all files you link to if you move the primary <code>.html</code> file.

<h2>Links are not typeset correctly  <a name="___sec7"></a></h2>

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>see the directory &quot;`examples`&quot;: &quot;src/examples/index.html&quot;.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>see the &quot;`examples`&quot;: &quot;src/examples/index.html&quot; directory.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

<h2>Inline verbatim code is not detected  <a name="___sec8"></a></h2>

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

<h2>Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly  <a name="___sec9"></a></h2>

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

<h2>Strange non-English characters  <a name="___sec10"></a></h2>

The former reason for this problem is that Doconce could only work with latin1
(ISO-8859) encoding and not UTF-8. After May 2013, Doconce applies
UTF-8 both for HTML and LaTeX.

<p>
Check the encoding of the <code>.do.txt</code> file with the Unix <code>file</code> command
or with
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
If the encoding is UTF-8, convert to latin1 using either of
the Unix commands
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce change_encoding utf-8 latin1 myfile.do.txt
Terminal&gt; iconv -f utf-8 -t latin1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h2>Wrong Norwegian charcters  <a name="___sec11"></a></h2>

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run <code>doconce change_encoding</code> to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

<h2>Too short underlining of reST headlines  <a name="___sec12"></a></h2>

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

<h2>Found <code>!bt</code> but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)  <a name="___sec13"></a></h2>

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first <code>!bt</code> (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

<h2>Examples are typset with environment delimiters visible  <a name="___sec14"></a></h2>

If you see an Example section containing <code>!bsubex</code>, <code>!bsol</code>, or other
begin and end tags for environments, it means that you have intended
to typeset examples as exercises, but forgotten the command-line
option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code>. The text in the example is typeset
as is unless this option is included.

<h2>Emacs editing does not work properly because of "regexp overflow"  <a name="___sec15"></a></h2>

Sometimes the Doonce editing mode (see the section ref{emacs:doconce}) in Emacs
leads to an error message ending with "overflow in regexp matcher".
This error is due to some regular expression used in the Doconce editing
mode. The remedy is to split the file into smaller pieces and include
the pieces using the <code>preprocess</code> directive <code>#include "piece.do.txt"</code>.
The error message comes with the Doconce file contains too much text
for Emacs to handle.

<h2>My machine hangs if I have many movies  <a name="___sec16"></a></h2>

Doconce has no limits on the amount of movies. When the output is
in HTML, one big HTML file may contain too many movies (local movie
files or embedded YouTube movies) for the browser to handle.
The remedy is to split the document into smaller pieces by inserting

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!split
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
for every new page. After <code>doconce format html mydoc</code>, run
<code>doconce split_html mydoc.html</code> to get the document split into
a main document <code>mydoc.html</code> and pieces <code>._mydocXXX.html</code>, where
<code>XXX</code> stands for three digits (<code>000</code>, <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, and so forth).

<h2>How can I use quotes in a link?  <a name="___sec17"></a></h2>

Links are typeset inside double quotes, but Doconce applies double backticks
and double single quotes to typeset quotes, so the right form is

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>&quot;This is a ``link text'' to google&quot;: &quot;http://google.com&quot;.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
It appears as

<h2>Conversion from Doconce to Google Docs  <a name="___sec18"></a></h2>

<ul>
 <li> Transform the Doconce document to HTML, upload to Google Drive,
   right-click the file and open as Google Docs.</li>
 <li> It might be necessary to adjust formatting, e.g., insert an extra
   line between paragraphs.</li>
 <li> MathJax code is not converted to the Google Docs LaTeX counterpart
   and appears verbatim.</li>
 <li> Pygmentized computer code and admons look fine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Convesion from Google Docs to Doconce  <a name="___sec19"></a></h2>

<ul>
 <li> Save as HTML file and use Pandoc to convert to Markdown.
   Use the <code>--markdown</code> and <code>--md2do_output=</code> options to
   `doconce format to convert to Doconce.</li>
 <li> Lists in Markdown must be intended.</li>
 <li> Notes in Google Docs become (potentially many) footnotes.
   Some tailored editing is necessary.</li>
</ul>

This solution is not much explored and more text transformations from
Pandoc-generated Markdown is certainly needed.

<h2>Are there any tools for shared online writing of Doconce documents?  <a name="___sec20"></a></h2>

In theory, <a href="http://draftin.com" target="_self"><tt>http://draftin.com</tt></a> and <a href="https://stackedit.io" target="_self"><tt>https://stackedit.io</tt></a>
can be used to share Markdown documents and these can be transform
to and from Doconce documents. Tested to a little degree, but may
work for very simple documents (sections, lists, code - no labels, refs,
math, admons, code copied from file).
Not all of Extended Markdown is interpreted by Doconce, and Doconce
transforms to Panddoc-extended Markdown, not the Extended Markdown
used by these sites.

<h1>Preprocess/Mako problems  <a name="___sec21"></a></h1>

<h2>The Mako preprocessor is seemingly not run  <a name="___sec22"></a></h2>

If you have lines starting with <code>%</code> inside code segments (for example,
SWIG code or Matlab comment lines), the Mako preprocessor will crash
because it thinks these lines are Mako statements. Doconce detects
this problem and avoids running Mako.  Examine the output from
Doconce: warnings are issued if Mako is not run.

<h2>The Mako preprocessor gives strange error messages  <a name="___sec23"></a></h2>

If you to a little syntax error in Mako, the consequences can be
quite unpredictable. Especially, if you forget curly braces around
variables or function calls, the forthcoming text is processed as
part of the Mako command. Pay attention to the line number reported
by Mako: this is the line number after Preprocess has processed
the Doconce document, so you need to load <code>tmp_preprocess__mydoc.do.txt</code>
and go to the right line in that file to see the Mako problem
(here the Doconce document is named <code>mydoc.do.txt</code>).

<p>
Look through the specific Mako problems
reported below, and if they do not bring you to a solution of
the problem, search for all occurences of dollar, left curly brace
and check the syntax carefully. Likewise, check the syntax of
Mako if-tests.

<p>
Another widely used technique is to copy out small parts of
the complete document to a separate file and run <code>doconce format</code>.
In this way you can easier see which parts of the document that
work and where the error suddenly appears.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal"><b>Tip: Compile your Doconce document frequently.</b>
The best means against Mako problems is to run <code>doconce format</code>
often. Combined Git, you can take
a <code>git diff</code> to see what you have recently changed and get an idea
what can be wrong.
</div>


<h2>The Mako preprocessor is fooled by Doconce text  <a name="___sec24"></a></h2>

Here are possible problems for Mako:

<ul>
 <li> Strings with <code>'T<%.1f'</code> look as openings of Mako blocks (<code><%</code>); change
   to <code>'T < %.1f'</code> to avoid this confusion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Mako preprocessor claims a variable is undefined  <a name="___sec25"></a></h2>

Very often such errors are related to typos when using Mako
variables or functions, or correct yet undesired LaTeX syntax.
For example, \( {\cal O}(\Delta x^2) \) is valid LaTeX, but
the dollar sign and curly braces confuse Mako. Rewrite such
mathematics. It is wise to not use <code>${</code> anywhere in LaTeX mathematics.
Create a newcommand if there are no other possible rewritings.
A known common problem is <code>${}^+$</code> type of indication of superscripts.
A suggested rewrite is <code>$\,{}^+$</code>.

<p>
The error message will ask you to rerun <code>doconce</code> with
<code>--mako_strict_undefined</code>, which will display the variable that is
confusing Mako. Sometimes the variable is printed, sometimes a totally
different name is said to be undefined. This is confusing, because
then you have to use the bisection method below to narrow down the
problem yourself.

<p>
Do not continue to use <code>--mako_strict_undefined</code> while you are
debugging because this variable or a new variable will then always be
undefined in that mode.  Rerun without <code>--mako_strict_undefined</code> to
see if the problem is gone. If not, try the option again, and if no
progress, use <code># #ifdef</code> directives to comment out large portions of
the text and apply a bisection procedure to locate where the Mako
problem is (without <code>--mako_strict_undefined</code>).  A bisection procedure
means that you comment out the last half, find in which half the
problem is, comment out half of that half, find in which half the
problem is, and so on. The procedure converges pretty quickly, even
for large books.

<h2>Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step  <a name="___sec26"></a></h2>

You can examine <code>tmp_preprocess__filename</code> and <code>tmp_mako__filename</code>,
where <code>filename</code> is the complete name of the Doconce file, to see
what the preprocessors actually to and if something is wrong in these
files before Doconce starts translating the text.
One or both of those files may be missing, but examine the beginning
of the output from Doconce to see exactly which preprocessors are run
and on which files.

<h2>Preprocessor directives do not work  <a name="___sec27"></a></h2>

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

<h1>Problems with code or Tex Blocks  <a name="___sec28"></a></h1>

<h2>Code or math block errors in reST  <a name="___sec29"></a></h2>

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

<p>
Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a <code>!bc</code>, which should have been removed when
running <code>doconce format sphinx</code>, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then <code>!bc</code> will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

<h2>Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST  <a name="___sec30"></a></h2>

If <code>idx</code> commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

<h2>Something is wrong with a verbatim code block  <a name="___sec31"></a></h2>

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

<h2>Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format  <a name="___sec32"></a></h2>

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before <code>!bt</code> and <code>!bc</code> environments.

<h2>Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly  <a name="___sec33"></a></h2>

Read the the section ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} above.  Start the
<code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

<h2>LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly  <a name="___sec34"></a></h2>

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the <code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code> tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

<h1>Problems with reST/Sphinx Output  <a name="___sec35"></a></h1>

<h2>Title level inconsistent  <a name="___sec36"></a></h2>

reST does not like jumps in the levels of headings. For example, you cannot
have a <code>===</code> (paragraph) heading after a <code>=======</code> (section) heading without
a <code>====</code> (subsection) heading in between.

<h2>Lists do not appear in .rst files  <a name="___sec37"></a></h2>

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

<h2>Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST  <a name="___sec38"></a></h2>

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

<h2>Warning about duplicate link names  <a name="___sec39"></a></h2>

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

<h2>Inconsistent headings in reST  <a name="___sec40"></a></h2>

The <code>rst2*.py</code> and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for <code>===</code>,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

<h2>No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks  <a name="___sec41"></a></h2>

The <code>!bc ipy</code> directive behaves this way for <code>sphinx</code> output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to <code>!bc cod</code> or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

<h1>Problems with LaTeX Output  <a name="___sec42"></a></h1>

<h2>LaTeX does not like underscores in URLs  <a name="___sec43"></a></h2>

Suppose you have a URL reference like

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>..which can be found in the file &quot;my_file.txt&quot;:
&quot;http://some.where.net/web/dir/my_file.txt&quot;.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
LaTeX will stop with a message about a missing dollar sign. The reason
is that underscores in link texts need to be preceded by a backslash.
However, this is incovenient to do in the Doconce source since the
underscore is misleading in other formats.
The remedy is to format the link text with inline verbatim tags (backticks):
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>..which can be found in the file &quot;`my_file.txt`&quot;:
&quot;http://some.where.net/web/dir/my_file.txt&quot;.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Verbatim text in links works fine with underscores.

<h2>How can I have unnumbered sections?  <a name="___sec44"></a></h2>

Do an automatic edit like this:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h2>Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed  <a name="___sec45"></a></h2>

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the <code>-shell-escape</code> command-line argument when
running <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code>:
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Using <code>doconce ptex2tex</code> will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using <code>ptex2tex</code> requires the
preprocessor option <code>-DMINTED</code> to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> runs the
<code>pygmentize</code> program and the <code>shell-escape</code> option is required.

<h2>Why are the LaTeX section headings smaller than normal?  <a name="___sec46"></a></h2>

Doconce inserts a special command to make the headings
more compact:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>\usepackage[compact]{titlesec}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
as explained in the <a href="http://www.ctex.org/documents/packages/layout/titlesec.pdf" target="_self"><tt>titlesec</tt></a> package documentation.
To retrieve the standard LaTeX headings, comment out this line or remove it:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce format pdflatex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce subst '\\usepack.+\{titlesec\} '' mydoc.p.tex
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
You can easily make the headings even smaller than the normal font
by replacing <code>[compact]</code> by <code>[compact,small]</code> as parameter specification
for <code>titlesec</code>.

<h2>I get LaTeX compilation errors about "shadedquoteBlue" in code blocks in exercises  <a name="___sec47"></a></h2>

When using colored boxes for code in LaTeX, a code snippet is needed
in the ordinary running text <em>before</em> code snippets inside exercises, problems,
or projects. This is a kind of bug in Doconce that is challenging to fix.
It is usually only a problem when writing documents mainly containing
exercises, problems, or projects.

<h2>Can I have LaTeX figures with shadows?  <a name="___sec48"></a></h2>

This is easy by including the <code>fancybox</code> and <code>graphicx</code> packages
and wrapping all <code>\includegraphics</code> in a shadow box:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce format pdflatex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce replace \
          'microtype}', 'microtype,fancybox,graphicx}' mydoc.p.tex
Terminal&gt; doconce subst '(\\includegraphics\[.+\}\})' \
          '\\shadowbox{\g&lt;1&gt;}' mydoc.p.tex
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h2>How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?  <a name="___sec49"></a></h2>

See the section ref{manual:theorem:envir} for how to make a custom
theorem environment also in Doconce, without using implementations
restricted to LaTeX.

<h2>The LaTeX file does not compile  <a name="___sec50"></a></h2>

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>\code{...}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

<h2>The LaTeX Beamer file does not compile  <a name="___sec51"></a></h2>

Make sure you have a <code>!split</code> before every slide heading.

<h2>Inline verbatim gives error   <a name="___sec52"></a></h2>

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

<p>
<!-- Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is -->
<!-- configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}. -->

<h2>Errors in figure captions  <a name="___sec53"></a></h2>

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

<p>
(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper <code>texttt</code> command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

<h2>Chapters are ignored  <a name="___sec54"></a></h2>

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run <code>ptex2tex</code> with the option <code>-DBOOK</code> to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

<h2>I want to tune the top (preamble) of the LaTeX file  <a name="___sec55"></a></h2>

The default preamble generated by Doconce has several <code>preprocess</code>
options to set the font, type of titlepage, etc., when running
<code>ptex2tex</code> or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>. However, it is easy to provide
a customized preamble text:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc --latex_preamble=mytop.tex
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
If <code>mytop.tex</code> starts with a <code>documentclass</code> specification, the whole
file becomes the complete preamble in <code>mydoc.p.tex</code>, otherwise
<code>mytop.tex</code> is added at the end of the preamble generated by
Doconce.

<p>
Note also that <code>doconce replace</code> and <code>doconce subst</code> can be used
after <code>doconce formt</code> to tune the LaTeX code in the preamble.
There are comment lines with <code>--- begin preamble ---</code> and
<code>--- end preamble ---</code> in the generate <code>.p.tex</code> file that can be
used to replace the whole preamble by something more suitable.

<h1>Problems with gwiki Output  <a name="___sec56"></a></h1>

<h2>Strange nested lists in gwiki  <a name="___sec57"></a></h2>

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the <code>.gwiki</code> file directly.

<h2>Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source  <a name="___sec58"></a></h2>

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

<h1>Problems with HTML Output  <a name="___sec59"></a></h1>

<h2>MathJax formulas are not properly rendered  <a name="___sec60"></a></h2>

Here are some common problems:

<ul>
 <li> Two equations cannot have identical label (this error often arises
   from copying and pasting equations)</li>
 <li> <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> brackets must sometimes be replaced by <code>\lbrack</code> and <code>\rbrack</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>How can I change the layout of the HTML page?  <a name="___sec61"></a></h2>

The easiest way is to edit the HTML style or the HTML code directly.
However, those edits are overwritten the next time you compile the
Doconce document to HTML. The edits should therefore be automated
using <code>doconce subst</code> (for regular expression editing) or <code>doconce replace</code>
(for plain text substitution editing) commands in the file where
you run <code>doconce format html mydoc</code>. For example, say you want narrower
gray admonition boxes with a much thicker boundary. The <code>.alert</code>
style must then be changed, more precisely the <code>border</code> and the <code>width</code>
specification:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  shcod-->
<pre><code>doconce replace 'border:1px' 'border:11px' mydoc.html
doconce replace 'width: 75%;' 'width: 35%' mydoc.html
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Another way to control the layout is to copy the style in the HTML
file into a <code>.css</code> file, edit that file as you like, and provide the
file as part of the compilation using the <code>--css=mystyle.css</code>
flag.

<p>
The standard of way of completely controlling the HTML format is to
use an HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text
(leave out <code>TITLE:</code> to get HTML without a header and footer). The
<code>--html_template=filename</code> command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.  The template
can have "slots" for a title (<code>%(title)s</code>), a date (<code>%(date)s</code>), and
the main body of text (<code>%(main)s</code>).  For typesetting code, <code>pygments</code>
is used (if installed) and can be turned off by <code>--no_pygments_html</code>
(leaving code in gray boxes).

<p>
The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the <code>sphinx</code> format and one its many themes.

<h2>Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?  <a name="___sec62"></a></h2>

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>doconce replace '&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;' \
 '&lt;p style=&quot;width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue&quot;&gt;' mydoc.html
doconce replace '&lt;hr class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;' \
 '&lt;hr style=&quot;width: 50%&quot;&gt;' mydoc.html
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h1>Problems with reveal/deck HTML5 slides  <a name="___sec63"></a></h1>

<h2>Reveal slides are moving steadily to the left  <a name="___sec64"></a></h2>

This seems to be a problem when one has used the mouse to scroll down
on a slide and continue to use the right arrow for moving to the
next slide. Click on the arrow in the slide instead of using the arrow key.

<h2>YouTube movies do not work  <a name="___sec65"></a></h2>

They do not work in reveal or deck unless the Chrome browser is used.
Usually the HTML5 slides work best in Firefox.

<h2>Online Python Tutor does not work  <a name="___sec66"></a></h2>

Seems to be a problem with reveal slides. The <em>Forward</em> button is not
clickable.
