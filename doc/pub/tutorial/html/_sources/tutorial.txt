   and loops to parameterize the text and generate various versions of
   the text for different purposes.

 * Computer code can be copied directly from parts of source code files.

 * Running text can quickly be edited to slide formats (reveal.js and deck.js,
   based on HTML5+CSS3).

 * Special exercise environments with support for hints, answers,
   subexercises, etc.

 * Automatic inline embedding of YouTube and Vimeo movies.

 * Good support for admonitions in various LaTeX and HTML styles
   for warnings, questions, hints, remarks, summaries, etc.

What Does DocOnce Look Like?
============================

DocOnce text looks like ordinary text (much like Markdown [#markdown-input]_),
but there
are some almost invisible text constructions that allow you to control
the formating. Here are some examples.

  * Bullet lists automatically arise from lines starting with ``*``,
    or ``o`` if the list is to be enumerated.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by ``*``. **Words in boldface**
    are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in backticks and
    then typeset ``verbatim (in a monospace font)``.

  * Section and paragraph headings are recognied special
    decorating characters (``=`` or ``_``) before and after the heading.
    The length of the decoration determines the level of the
    section.

  * Blocks of computer code are included by surrounding the blocks with
    ``!bc`` (begin code) and ``!ec`` (end code) tags on separate lines.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are included by surrounding the blocks
    with ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and ``!et`` (end TeX) tags on separate lines.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics
    such that formulas make sense also when not rendered by LaTeX
    or MathJax.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
    YouTube and Vimeo videos are automatically embedded in web documents.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Special comment lines are not visible in the output.

  * Comments to authors can be inserted throughout the text and
    made visible or invisible as desired.

  * There is an exercise environment with many advanced features.

  * With a preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include other
    documents (files), large portions of text can be defined in or out
    of the text, and tailored format-specific constructs can easily be
    included. With Mako a single text can output its program examples
    in two or more languages.

.. [#markdown-input] In fact, DocOnce allows basic
   `GitHub/extended Markdown syntax <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`__ as input. This is attractive for newcomers from Markdown or
   writers who also write Markdown documents (or uses Markdown frequently at
   GitHub).

What Can DocOnce Be Used For?
-----------------------------

LaTeX is ideal for articles, thesis, and books, but the PDF files does
not look fresh and modern on tablets and phones or big computer
screens. For the latter type of media you need HTML-based documents
with strong support for nice layouts. Tools like
Sphinx, Markdown, or plain HTML with Bootstrap are then more
appropriate than LaTeX, but involves a very different syntax.
DocOnce lets you write one text in one place and then generate
the most appropriate language for the media you want to target.
DocOnce also
has many extra features for supporting large documents with much code and
mathematics, not found in any of other publishing tool.

Basic Syntax
------------

Here is an example of some simple text written in the DocOnce format:

.. code-block:: text

        ======= First a Section Heading with 7 = Characters =======
        
        ===== Then a Subsection Heading with 5 = Characters =====
        
        === Finally a Subsubection Heading with 3 = Characters ===
        
        You can also have paragraphs with a paragraph heading surrounded
        by double underscores are the beginning of a line.
        
        __This is a paragraph heading.__
        And here comes the text.
        
        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, but must always start at the
        beginning of lines. Tags used for _boldface_ words, *emphasized*
        words, and `computer` words look natural in plain text.  Quotations
        appear inside double backticks and double single quotes, as in ``this
        example''.
        
        Below the section title we have a *label*, which can be used to
        refer to Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        References to equations, such as (ref{myeq1}), work in the same
        LaTeX-inspired way.
        
        Lists are typeset as you would do in email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2,
            perhaps with a 2nd line
          * item 3
        
        Note the consistent use of indentation (as in Python programming!).
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3,
            but be careful with the indentation of the next lines!
        
        __Hyperlinks.__
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is just URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in URL: "tutorial.do.txt". DocOnce distinguishes between paper
        and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
        generated from DocOnce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
        With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
        the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.
        
        __Inline comments.__
        DocOnce also allows inline comments of the form [name: comment] (with
        a space after `name:`), e.g., such as [hpl: here I will make some
        remarks to the text]. Inline comments can be removed from the output
        by a command-line argument (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an
        example). Inline comments can also be used for detailed editing of
        text, much like track changes in word, to illustrate how a text
        is revised. (However, for seeing how others have revised the text, I
        strongly recommend using Git for version control and running `git diff`
        on the appropriate versions, or you can click on differences at
        GitHub if the files are hosted there.)
        
        __Footnotes.__ Adding a footnote[^footnote] is also possible.
        
        [^footnote]: The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.
        
        __Tables.__
        Tables are also written in the plain text way, e.g.,
        
          |--c--------c-----------c--------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        The characters `c`, `r`, and `l` can be inserted, as illustrated above,
        for aligning the headings and the columns (center, right, left).
        
        # Lines beginning with # are comment lines.

The DocOnce text above results in the following little document:

.. !split

First a Section Heading with 7 = Characters
===========================================

Then a Subsection Heading with 5 = Characters
---------------------------------------------

Finally a Subsubection Heading with 3 = Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also have paragraphs with a paragraph heading surrounded
by double underscores are the beginning of a line.

**This is a paragraph heading.**
And here comes the text.

.. _my:first:sec:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, but must always start at the
beginning of lines. Tags used for **boldface** words, *emphasized*
words, and ``computer`` words look natural in plain text.  Quotations
appear inside double backticks and double single quotes, as in "this
example".

Below the section title we have a *label*, which can be used to
refer to the section :ref:`my:first:sec`.
References to equations, such as ':eq:`myeq1`', work in the same
LaTeX-inspired way.

Lists are typeset as you would do in email,

  * item 1

  * item 2,
    perhaps with a 2nd line

  * item 3

Note the consistent use of indentation (as in Python programming!).
Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3,
    but be careful with the indentation of the next lines!

**Hyperlinks.**
URLs with a link word are possible, as in `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__.
If the word is just URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in `<tutorial.do.txt>`_. DocOnce distinguishes between paper
and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
generated from DocOnce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.

**Inline comments.**
DocOnce also allows inline comments of the form [**name 1**: comment] (with
a space after ``name:``), e.g., such as [**hpl 2**: here I will make some remarks to the text]. Inline comments can be removed from the output
by a command-line argument (see the section :ref:`doconce2formats` for an
example). Inline comments can also be used for detailed editing of
text, much like track changes in word, to illustrate how a text
is revised. (However, for seeing how others have revised the text, I
strongly recommend using Git for version control and running ``git diff``
on the appropriate versions, or you can click on differences at
GitHub if the files are hosted there.)

**Footnotes.**
Adding a footnote [#footnote]_ is also possible.

.. [#footnote] The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.

**Tables.**
Tables are also written in the plain text way, e.g.,

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
 0.0    1.4186         -5.01  
 2.0  1.376512        11.919  
 4.0    1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The characters ``c``, ``r``, and ``l`` can be inserted, as illustrated above,
for aligning the headings and the columns (center, right, left).

.. Lines beginning with # are comment lines.

Mathematics
-----------

Inline mathematics, such as :math:`\nu = \sin(x)` is written exactly as in LaTeX:

.. code-block:: text

        $\nu = \sin(x)$

Blocks of mathematics are typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
``!bt`` and ``!et`` (begin TeX, end TeX) directives:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f,
        label{myeq1}\\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}
        !et

The result looks like this:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u + f, 
        

.. math::
          
        {\partial v\over\partial t} = \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics
(this includes ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``ipynb``, ``pandoc``,
and ``mwiki``). Simpler
formats have to just list the raw
LaTeX syntax.

LaTeX writers who adopt DocOnce need to pay attention to the following:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the ``html``, ``sphinx``,
   and ``ipynb`` formats.

 * Only five equation environments can be used: ``\[ ... \]``,
   ``equation*``, ``equation``, ``align*``, and ``align``.

 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed (but not in
   the running text). Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   ``newcommands*.tex``.

 * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.
   DocOnce has extended Markdown, Sphinx, and HTML to better support
   equation referencing (across web pages for example).

 * Only figures are floating elements in DocOnce, all other elements
   (code, tables, algorithms) are *inline* without numbers or labels
   for reference. The reason is that floating elements are in general
   not used in web documents, but we made an exception with figures
   and movies.


.. admonition:: Remark

   Although DocOnce allows user-defined styles in the preamble of LaTeX output,
   HTML-based output cannot make use of such styles. If-else constructs for
   the preprocessor can be used to allow special LaTeX environments for
   LaTeX output and alternative typesetting for other formats, but it is
   recommended to stay away from special environments in the text and
   write in a simpler fashion. For example, DocOnce has no special construction
   for algorithms, so these must be simulated by lists or verbatim blocks.
   Other constructions that should be avoided include margin notes, special
   tables, and
   ``subfigure`` (combine image files to one file instead, via ``doconce combine_images``).




Computer Code
-------------

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` instructions, respectively.

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pycod
        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
        !ec

Such blocks are formatted as

.. code-block:: python

        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to ``sphinx``, ``rst``, and formats close to plain text),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

Blocks of computer code has *named environments*, such as *pycod*. The *py*
stands for Python and *cod* indicates a code snippet that cannot be run
without more code. Another example is *fpro*, *f* for Fortran and *pro* for
a complete program that will run as it stands. There is support for
code in C, C++, Fortran, Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and LaTeX,

.. Note: the @@@CODE command starts in column 2 below such that we fool

.. DocOnce to drop copying the file...

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts, e.g,

.. code-block:: text

         @@@CODE src/myprog.py fromto: def regression\(@import mymod

The copying is based on regular expressions and not on line numbers, which
makes the specifications much more robust during software and document
developing. With the ``@@@CODE`` command,
computer code is never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!) and once the software is updated, the
next compilation of the document is up-to-date.

**Inclusion of files.**
Another DocOnce document or any file
can be included by writing ``# #include "mynote.do.txt"``
at the beginning of a line.  DocOnce documents have
extension ``do.txt``. The ``do`` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing ``.txt`` denotes a text document so that editors gives you
plain text editing capabilities.

.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

DocOnce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands are defined in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``, using standard LaTeX syntax. Only newcommands
for use inside math environments are supported.

Labels, corss-references, citations, and support of an index and
bibliography are much inspired by LaTeX syntax, but DocOnce features
no backslashes. Use labels for sections and equations only, and
preceed the reference by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of
an equation, surround the reference by parenthesis.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: text

        ===== My Section =====
        label{sec:mysec}
        
        idx{key equation} idx{$\u$ conservation}
        
        We refer to Section ref{sec:yoursec} for background material on
        the *key equation*. Here we focus on the extension
        
        # \Ddt, \u and \mycommand are defined in newcommands_keep.tex
        
        !bt
        \begin{equation}
        \Ddt{\u} = \mycommand{v},
        label{mysec:eq:Dudt}
        \end{equation}
        !et
        where $\Ddt{\u}$ is the material derivative of $\u$.
        Equation (ref{mysec:eq:Dudt}) is important in a number
        of contexts, see cite{Larsen_et_al_2002,Johnson_Friedman_2010a}.
        Also, cite{Miller_2000} supports such a view.
        
        As see in Figure ref{mysec:fig:myfig}, the key equation
        features large, smooth regions *and* abrupt changes.
        
        FIGURE: [fig/myfile, width=600 frac=0.9] My figure. label{mysec:fig:myfig}
        
        ===== References =====
        
        BIBFILE: papers.pub

DocOnce applies `Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`__ for specifying bibliographies because
this tool has more functionality than BibTeX, but any BibTeX database can
be automatically converted to the simple Publish format.

For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the ``doc/manual/manual.do.txt`` file
in the DocOnce source and a `Sphinx version <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/>`__ of this document.

.. !split

.. _doconce2formats:

From DocOnce to Other Formats
=============================

.. index::
   single: doconce commands; format

Transformation of a DocOnce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats is done with the script ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format formatname mydoc.do.txt

or just drop the extension:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format formatname mydoc

.. _do2any:make:

Generating a makefile
---------------------

Producing HTML, Sphinx, and in particular LaTeX documents from
DocOnce sources requires a few commands. Often you want to
produce several different formats. The relevant commands should
then be placed in a script that acts as a "makefile".

The ``doconce makefile`` can be used to automatically generate
such a makefile, more precisely a Python script ``make.py``, which
carries out the commands explained below. If our DocOnce source
is in ``main_myproj.do.txt``, we run

.. code-block:: text

        doconce makefile main_myproj html pdflatex sphinx

to produce the necessary output for generating HTML, pdfLaTeX, and
Sphinx. Usually, you need to edit ``make.py`` to really fit your
needs. Some examples lines are inserted as comments to show
various options that can be added to the basic commands.
A handy feature of the generated ``make.py`` script is that it
inserts checks for successful runs of the many ``doconce`` commands,
and if something goes wrong, the script aborts.

.. _do2any:pre:

Preprocessing
-------------

.. index:: preprocessing

.. index:: mako preprocessor

.. index:: preprocess preprocessor

The ``preprocess`` and ``mako`` programs are used to preprocess the
file. The DocOnce program detects whether ``preprocess`` and/or ``mako``
statements are present and runs the corresponding programs, first
``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.

Variables to ``preprocess`` and/or ``mako`` can be added after the
filename with the syntax ``-DMYVAR``, ``-DMYVAR=val`` or ``MYVAR=val``.

 * The form ``-DMYVAR`` defines the variable ``MYVAR`` for ``preprocess`` (like the
   same syntax for the C preprocessor - ``MYVAR`` is defined, but has
   not specific value). When running ``mako``, ``-DMYVAR`` means that
   ``MYVAR`` has the (Python) value ``True``.

 * The expressions ``-DMYVAR=val`` and ``MYVAR=val`` are
   equivalent. When running ``preprocess``, ``MYVAR`` is defined and has
   the value ``val`` (``# #ifdef MYVAR`` and ``# #if MYVAR == "val"`` are both
   true tests), while for ``mako``, ``MYVAR`` exists as
   variable and has the value ``val`` (``% if MYVAR == "val"`` is true).

Note that ``MYVAR=False`` defines ``MYVAR`` in ``preprocess`` and
any test ``# #ifdef MYVAR`` is always true, regardless of the value one has
set ``MYVAR`` to, so a better test is
``# #if MYVAR == True``. In general, it is recommended to go with
``preprocess`` directives if the tests are very simple, as in
``# #ifdef MYVAR`` or ``# #if FORMAT == "latex"``, otherwise use
only ``mako`` syntax like ``% if MYVAR or YOURVAR:`` to incorporate
``if`` tests in the preprocessor phases.

Two examples on defining preprocessor variables are

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5
        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess`` or ``mako``. That is, in the above examples, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``sphinx``. Inside the DocOnce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "sphinx"``
(for ``preprocess``) or ``% if FORMAT == "sphinx":`` (for ``mako``).

The result of running ``preprocess`` on a DocOnce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is available in a file ``tmp_preprocess__mydoc.do.txt``. Similarly,
the result of running ``mako`` is available in
``tmp_mako__mydoc.do.txt``. By examining these files one can see exactly
what the preprocessors have done.

.. _do2any:inlinecomments:

Removal of inline comments
--------------------------

.. index:: inline comments

The command-line arguments ``--no_preprocess`` and ``--no_mako`` turn off
running ``preprocess`` and ``mako``, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original DocOnce
file by running:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a DocOnce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

.. _do2any:notes:

Notes
-----

.. index:: notes (visible/invisible)

DocOnce does not have a tag for longer notes, because implementation
of a "notes feature" is so easy using the ``preprocess`` or ``mako``
programs. Just introduce some variable, say ``NOTES``, that you define
through ``-DNOTES`` (or not) when running ``doconce format ...``. Inside
the document you place your notes between ``# #ifdef NOTES`` and
``# #endif`` preprocess tags. Alternatively you use ``% if NOTES:``
and ``% endif`` that ``mako`` will recognize. In the same way you may
encapsulate unfinished material, extra material to be removed
for readers but still nice to archive as part of the document for
future revisions.

Demo of different formats
-------------------------

.. index:: demos

A simple scientific report is available in `a lot of different formats <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/index_with_doconce_commands.html>`__.
How to create the different formats is explained in more depth
in the coming sections.

Useful Options for ``doconce format``
-------------------------------------

The ``doconce format`` command used to translate a DocOnce document to
an output format performs some syntax check and to notify the user
about common problems. There are some useful options for turning on
additional checks:

 * ``--labelcheck=on`` (or ``off``) to check that every ``ref`` reference
   has a corresponding ``label`` definition within the document (this check
   may lead to wrong diagnostics, e.g., when a label is defined in an
   external document and referred via generalized references, so the
   check must be used with care)

 * ``--urlcheck`` checks that all URLs referred to in the document are valid.

Other useful options are

 * ``--os_prompt=PROMPT>`` sets the prompt, here ``PROMPT>``, as terminal
   prompt in output from running OS commands with the ``@@@OSCMD`` instruction.
   The value ``None`` gives no prompt.

 * ``--code_prefix=X`` prefixes all ``@@@CODE`` imports with some path ``X``
   (if the source files are located in some other directory)

 * ``--figure_prefix=X`` and ``--movie_prefix=X`` prefix figure/movie file
   names with a path or URL

 * ``--sections_down`` and ``--sections_up`` move all sections down or up
   (e.g., sections become subsections or chapters).

 * ``--tables2csv`` translates each table to a CSV file.

 * ``--short_title=X`` sets a short title ``X`` for the document.

Many more options, depending on the output format, are listed in the
following sections.

HTML
----

.. index:: HTML output

.. index::
   single: output format; HTML

Basics
~~~~~~

Making an HTML version of a DocOnce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

.. index:: HTML syntax highlighting

Typesetting of Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Pygments package (including the ``pygmentize`` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument ``--no_pygments_html``
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain (``pre``) HTML tags. The option ``--pygments_html_linenos`` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks. A specific
Pygments style is set by ``--pygments_html_style=style``, where ``style``
can be ``default``, ``emacs``, ``perldoc``, and other valid names for
Pygments styles.

.. index:: HTML movies

.. index:: movies in HTML

Handling of Movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MP4, WebM, and Ogg movies are typeset with the HTML5 ``video`` tag
and the HTML code tries to load as many versions among MP4, WebM,
and Ogg as exist (and the files are loaded in the mentioned order).
If just the specified file is to be loaded, use the
``--no_mp4_webm_ogg_alternatives`` command-line option.
Other movie formats, e.g., ``.flv``, ``.mpeg`` and ``.avi``, are embedded via
the older ``embed`` tag.

.. index:: HTML layouts

HTML Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML style can be defined either in the header of the HTML file,
using a named built-in style;
in an external CSS file; or in a template file.

An external CSS file ``filename`` used by setting the command-line
argument ``--css=filename``. There available built-in styles are
specified as ``--html_style=name``, where ``name`` can be

 * ``solarized``: the famous `solarized <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>`__
   style (yellowish),

 * ``blueish``: a simple style with blue headings (default),

 * ``blueish2``: a variant of *bluish*,

 * ``bloodish``: as ``bluish``, but dark read as color,

 * ``bootstrap*`` or ``bootswatch*`` in a lot of variants, see
   ``doconce format --help`` for a list of all styles.

There is a `comprehensive demonstration <http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/index.html>`__ of almost all available styles!

Using ``--css=filename`` where ``filename`` is a non-existing file makes
DocOnce write the built-in style to that file. Otherwise the HTML
links to the CSS stylesheet in ``filename``. Several stylesheets can
be specified: ``--ccs=file1.css,file2.css,file3.css``.

.. index:: HTML templates

HTML templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Templates are HTML files with ready-made headers, footers, and style
specifications where plain HTML text can be inserted in "slots" in the
template file. Typically, there is a slot ``%(main)s`` for the main body
of text, ``%(title)s`` for the title, and ``%(date)s`` for the date.
Templates are designed beforehand and ``doconce format`` puts
the translated HTML text into the template to form the complete HTML
document.

DocOnce comes with a few ready-made HTML templates. The usage of templates is
described in a `separate document <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/design/>`__. That document describes how you your DocOnce-generated
HTML file can have any specified layout.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template with your own tailored
design, see a `tutorial <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tech_wrapper.htl>`__ on this topic. The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": ``%(title)s`` for a title,
``%(date)s`` for a date, and ``%(main)s`` for the main body of text. The
latter is the
DocOnce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the DocOnce document, or the title (but a title is not
recommended when using templates). The date is extracted from the
``DATE:`` line. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. DocOnce comes with
two templates in ``bundled/html_styles``. Just copy the directory
containing the template and the CSS and JavaScript files to your
document directory, edit the template as needed (also check that
paths to the ``css`` and ``js`` subdirectories are correct - according
to how you store the template files), and run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_template=mytemplate.html

The template in ``style_vagrant`` also needs an extra option
``--html_style=bootstrap``.

.. index:: splitting documents

.. index:: multi-page documents

Splitting HTML documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``!split`` instruction (on separate lines) signifies a pagebreak.
A command ``doconce split_html`` is needed after ``doconce format`` to
actually perform the split. The ``doconce split_html`` command has
several options for setting the type of splitting, type of navigation
buttons, etc. Just type ``doconce split_html`` to see the options.
Here is an example with separate links for each page (pagination)
at the top and bottom of each page:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=bootswatch_journal
        Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc --nav_buttontop+bottom --pagination

.. index:: HTML file collection

The HTML File Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are usually a range of files needed for an HTML document arising
from a DocOnce source. The needed files are listed in
``.basename_html_file_collection``, where ``basename`` is the filestem of
the DocOnce file (i.e., the DocOnce source is in ``basename.do.txt``).

Filenames
~~~~~~~~~

An HTML version of a DocOnce document is often made in different styles,
calling for a need to rename the HTML output file. This is conveniently
done by the ``--html_output=basename`` option, where ``basename`` is the
filestem of the associated HTML files. The
``.basename_html_file_collection`` file lists all the needed files
for the HTML document. Here is an example on making three versions of
the HTML document: ``mydoc_bloodish.html``, ``mydoc_solarized``, and
``mydoc_vagrant``.

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=bloodish \ 
                  --html_output=mydoc_bloodish
        Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc_bloodish.html
        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=solarized \ 
                  --html_output=mydoc_solarized \ 
                  --pygments_html_style=perldoc --html_admon=apricot
        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=vagrant \ 
                  --html_output=mydoc_vagrant --pygments_html_style=default \ 
                  --html_template=templates/my_adapted_vagrant_template.html
        Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc_vagrant.html

URL to files hosted on GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generated HTML code will have URLs to files in the DocOnce repo at GitHub.
The type of URL is set with the ``--html_raw_github_url=...`` option:

 * ``--html_raw_github_url=safe`` or ``--html_raw_github_url=cdn.rawgit``:
   safe URL for high traffic production sites (default)

 * ``--html_raw_github_url=test`` or ``--html_raw_github_url=rawgit``:
   recommended URL for low traffic development sites - use this when
   developing HTML pages and the DocOnce GitHub links in the HTML files
   are also developed and subject to changes

 * ``--html_raw_github_url=github`` or ``--html_raw_github_url=raw.github``:
   URL directly to the raw GitHub file (``https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/...``) that may fail to load properly in (e.g.) Internet explorer

 * ``--html_raw_github_url=githubusercontent`` or ``--html_raw_github_url=raw.githubusercontent``: as the one above, but using ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com`` instead

Other HTML options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options for Bootstrap styles:

 * ``--html_code_style=on,off,inherit,transparent``: control the style of
   inline verbatim code ``code`` tags. With ``off``, ``inherit``, or ``transparent``
   the verbatim text inherits foreground and background color from its
   surroundings, while ``on`` (default) means that the typesetting is
   css-specified. This option is most relevant for Bootstrap styles to
   avoid the redish typesetting of inline verbatim text.

 * ``--html_pre_style=on,off,inherit,transparent``: control the style of
   code blocks in ``pre`` tags. With ``off``, ``inherit``, or ``transparent``
   the code blocks inherit foreground and background color from their
   surroundings, while ``on`` (default) means that code block colors are
   css-specified. This option is most relevant for Bootstrap styles to
   avoid white background in code blocks inside colorful admons.

 * ``--html_bootstrap_navbar=on,off``: turn the Bootstrap navigation
   bar on or off.

 * ``--html_bootstrap_jumbotron=on,off,h2``: turn the jumbotron intro on or off,
   and govern the size of the document title. Default is ``on``, while
   ``h2`` means a jumbotron with ``h2`` (section) size of the title
   (normally the jumbotron has huge heading fonts so some jumbotrons
    look better with ``h2`` typesetting of the document title).

 * ``--html_quiz_button_text=X``: set a text on the answer button for
   Bootstrap-style quizzes. Without this option a small icon is used.

Other options:

 * ``--html_share=http://...`` makes sharing buttons at the end of the
   document: email, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, and print by
   default. ``--html_share=http://...,twitter,linkedin`` will make just
   to sharing buttons for Twitter and LinkedIn. Sites are separated
   by comma and valid names are ``email``, ``facebook``, ``google+``,
   ``linkedin``, ``twitter``, and ``print``. The URL ``http://...`` must be
   the URL where the document is published.

 * ``--html_toc_depth=X``: controls the depth of the table of contents
   in documents. Default value of ``X`` is 3, meaning chapters,
   sections, and subsections. ``X`` as 0 gives the table of contents as a
   nested list in Bootstrap styles.

 * ``--html_toc_indent=X``: indent sections/subsections ``X`` spaces in the table
   of contents.

 * ``--html_body_font=``: specify font for text body. The value ``?`` lists
   available fonts.

 * ``--html_heading_font=``: specify font for headings. The value ``?`` lists
   available fonts.

 * ``--html_video_autoplay=True,False``: let videos play automatically
   (``True``, default) or not (``False``) when the HTML page is loaded.

 * ``--html_admon=X``: specify typesetting of admonitions. Values of ``X``
   are ``colors``, ``gray``, ``yellow``, ``apricot``, ``lyx``, ``paragraph``.
   For Bootstrap styles only to other values are legal:
   ``botstrap_panel`` or ``bootstrap_alert``. See demos for how these look
   like.

 * ``--html_admon_bg_color=X``: set the background color in admonitions.

 * ``--html_admon_bd_color=X``: set the boundary color in admonitions.

 * ``--html_admon_shadow``: add a shadow effect in admonitions.

 * ``--html_box_shadow``: add a shadow effect in box environments (``!bbox``).

 * ``--html_exercise_icon=X``: specify an icon to more easily notify exercises.
   ``X`` can be any filename ``question_*.png`` in the ``bundled/html_images``
   directory in the DocOnce repo. With ``X`` as ``default``, a default icon
   choice is made, based on the current style.

 * ``--html_exercise_icon_width=X``: set the width of the exercise icon
   image to ``X`` pixels.

 * ``--exercise_numbering=absolute, chapter``

 * ``--html_DOCTYPE``: insert ``<!DOCTYPE HTML>`` at the top of the HTML
   output file. This is normally recommended, but malformed CSS files
   will then not be loaded (so by default, the doctype is not specified).
   This option is necessary for correct rendering of Bootstrap styles
   in Internet Explorer.

 * ``--html_links_in_new_window``: open all links as new tabs.

 * ``--html_figure_hrule=X``: control the use of horizontal rules in
   figures. ``X`` is ``top`` by default; other values are ``none`` (no rules),
   ``bottom`` and ``top+bottom``.

 * ``--allow_refs_to_external_docs`` (do not abort if there are references whose labels are not found)

.. _do2any:blog:

Blog Posts
----------

.. index:: blog posts

.. index:: Wordpress blog

.. index:: Google blogger

DocOnce can be used for writing blog posts provided the blog site accepts
raw HTML code. Google's Blogger service (``blogger.com`` or
``blogname.blogspot.com``) is particularly well suited since it also
allows extensive LaTeX mathematics via MathJax.

1. Write the text of the blog post as a DocOnce document without any
   title, author, and date.

2. Generate HTML as described above.

3. Copy the text and paste it into the
   text area in the blog post (just delete the HTML code that initially
   pops up in the text area). Make sure the input format is HTML.

See a `simple blog example <http://doconce.blogspot.no>`__ and
a `scientific report <http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/>`__
for demonstrations of blog posts at ``blogspot.no``.


.. warning::
    The comment field after the blog post does not recognize MathJax (LaTeX)
    mathematics or code with indentation. However, using a MathJax
    bookmarklet, e.g., at `<http://checkmyworking.com/misc/mathjax-bookmarklet/>`_, one can get the mathematics properly rendered. The comment fields are
    not suitable for computer code, though, as HTML tags are not allowed.





.. note::
   Figure files must be uploaded to some web site and the local filenames name must
   be replaced by the relevant URL. This is usually done by using the
   ``--figure_prefix=http://project.github.io/...`` option to give some URL
   as prefix to all figure names (a similar ``--movie_prefix=`` option exists as
   well).
   
   Changing figure names in a blog post can also be done "manually" by
   some editing code in the script that compiles the DocOnce document
   to HTML format:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
           cp mydoc.do.txt mydoc2.do.txt
           url="https//raw.github.com/someuser/someuser.github.com"
           dir="master/project/dir1/dir2"
           for figname in fig1 fig2 fig3; do
             doconce replace "[$figname," "[$site/$dir/$figname.png," \ 
                     mydoc2.do.txt
           done
           doconce format html mydoc2
           # Paste mydoc2.html into a new blog post page




.. See here if MathJax stops working in HTML pages on blogger and elsewhere:

.. `<http://weiqigao.blogspot.no/2013/03/enabling-mathjax-in-blogger.html>`_

Blog posts at Google can also be published `automatically through email <http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41452>`__.
A Python program can send the contents of the HTML file
to the blog site's email address using the packages  ``smtplib`` and ``email``.

WordPress (``wordpress.com``) allows raw HTML code in blogs, but has
very limited LaTeX support, basically only formulas. The ``--wordpress``
option to ``doconce`` modifies the HTML code such that all equations are
typeset in a way that is acceptable to WordPress.  Look at a `simple
doconce example <http://doconce.wordpress.com>`__ and a `scientific
report <http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/>`__ to see blog posts
with mathematics and code on WordPress.

Speaking of WordPress, the related project `<http://pressbooks.com>`_ can take raw HTML code (from DocOnce, for
instance, but use the ``--wordpress`` option)
and produce very nice-looking books.  There is support for LaTeX
mathematics as in WordPress blog posts, meaning that one cannot refer
to equations.

.. _do2any:pandoc:

Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

.. index::
   single: output format; Markdown

.. index::
   single: output format; Pandoc

.. index:: Markdown output

.. index:: Pandoc output

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

or (equivalent)

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format markdown mydoc

The name of the output file is ``mydoc.md``.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.md

Pandoc supports ``latex``, ``html``, ``odt`` (OpenOffice), ``docx`` (Microsoft
Word), ``rtf``, ``texinfo``, to mention some. The ``-R`` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the ``--toc`` option generates a table of contents.
See the `Pandoc documentation <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>`__
for the many features of the ``pandoc`` program.

Markdown to HTML conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML output from
``pandoc`` needs adjustments to provide full support for MathJax LaTeX
mathematics, and for this purpose one should use ``doconce md2html``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> doconce m2html mydoc

The result ``mydoc.html`` can be viewed in a browser.

.. index::
   single: output format; strict Markdown

Strict Markdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option ``--strict_markdown_output`` generates plain or strict
Markdown without the many extension that Pandoc accepts in Markdown
syntax.

.. index::
   single: output format; GitHub-flavored Markdown

GitHub-flavored Markdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding the command-line option ``github-md`` turns on the
`GutHub-flavored Markdown dialect <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>`__, which is used for the issue tracker on `GitHub <http://github.com>`__. A special feature is the support of task lists:
unnumbered lists with ``[x]`` (task done) or ``[ ]`` (task not done).
(Tables get typeset directly as HTML and the syntax for code highlighting
is different from Pandoc extended Markdown.) Below is a typical
response in a GitHub issue tracker
where one first quotes the issue and then provides an answer:

.. code-block:: text

        !bquote
        ===== Problems with a function =====
        
        There is a problem with the `f(x)` function
        
        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return 1 + x
        !ec
        This function should be quadratic.
        !equote
        
        OK, this is fixed:
        
        !bc pycod
        def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
            return a*x**2 + b*x + c
        !ec
        
        ===== Updated task list =====
        
           * [x] Offer an `f(x)` function
           * [ ] Extension to cubic functions
           * [x] Allowing general coefficient in the quadratic function
        
        === Remaining functionality ===
        
        |---------------------------------------------------------------|
        | function | purpose                        | state |
        |----l-----------l------------------------------l---------------|
        |  `g(x)`  | Compute the Gaussian function. | Formula ready. |
        |  `h(x)`  | Heaviside function.            | Formula ready. |
        |  `I(x)`  | Indicator function.            | Nothing done yet. |
        |---------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Say this text is stored in a file ``mycomments.do.txt``. Running

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mycomments --github_md

produces the Markdown file ``mycomments.md``, which can be pasted into
the Write field of
the GitHub issue tracker. Turning on Preview shows the typesetting of
the quote, compute code, inline verbatim, headings, the task list, and
the table.

MultiMarkdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option ``--multimarkdown_output`` generates the MultiMarkdown
version of Markdown (as opposed to Pandoc-extended Markdown (default),
strict Markdown, or GitHub-flavored Markdown).

.. index::
   single: output format; strapdown Markdown

Strapdown rendering of Markdown text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Strapdown <http://strapdownjs.com>`__ is a tool that can render Markdown
text nicely in a web browser by just inserting an HTML header and
footer in the Markdown file and load the file into a browser.
The option ``--strapdown`` outputs the relevant header and footer.
The output file must be renamed such that it gets the extension ``.html``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc --strict_markdown_output \ 
                  --strapdown --bootstrap_bootwatch_theme=slate
        Terminal> mv mydoc.md mydoc.html

The ``--bootstrap_bootwatch_theme=theme`` option is used to choose
a `Bootswatch <http://bootswatch.com/>`__ theme whose names are
found on the `Strapdown page <http://strapdownjs.com>`__.

Using Pandoc to go from LaTeX to MS Word or HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS
Word.  There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your
document): ``doconce format pandoc`` and then translating using ``doconce
md2latex`` (which runs ``pandoc``), or ``doconce format latex``, and then
going from LaTeX to the desired format using ``pandoc``.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce replace '\Verb!' '\verb!' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through ``pandoc``, only single equations, ``align``, or ``align*``
environments are well understood for output to HTML.

Note that DocOnce applies the ``Verb`` macro from the ``fancyvrb`` package
while ``pandoc`` only supports the standard ``verb`` construction for
inline verbatim text.  Moreover, quite some additional ``doconce
replace`` and ``doconce subst`` edits might be needed on the ``.mkd`` or
``.tex`` files to successfully have mathematics that is well translated
to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using Pandoc, it can
be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

.. _do2any:latex:

LaTeX: Overview
---------------

.. index:: LaTeX output

.. index::
   single: output format; LaTeX


.. note::
   XeLaTeX and pdfLaTeX are used very much in the same way as standard
   LaTeX. The minor differences are described in separate sections
   of the documentation of the DocOnce to LaTeX translation.




Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` can be done in two
ways:

1. direct translation to a ``.tex`` file

2. translation to a ``.p.tex`` file

In the latter case, one must apply the ``ptex2tex`` program or the
simplified ``doconce ptex2tex`` program to translate the ``.p.tex`` file
to a plain ``.tex`` file. This step involves the specification of how
blocks of verbatim code should be typeset in LaTeX. Before 2015,
DocOnce always translated to the ``.p.tex`` syntax and required the
use of ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``. Now, one can choose a direct
translation, which is simpler and actually more versatile than even
using the ``ptex2tex`` program.

Direct translation is specified by the ``--latex_code_style=`` command-line
option. A separate document, `Demonstration of DocOnce support for LaTeX code block environments <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/latexcode/demo.html>`__, describes how this option is used and the demonstrates
many possibilities that are available.
The ``--latex_code_style=`` option makes the use of ``ptex2tex`` or
``doconce ptex2tex`` redundant.

The old ``ptex2tex`` step
-------------------------

Here, we describe the old translation via a ``.p.tex`` file.
New users should jump over this information and use
the ``--latex_code_style=`` option to specify verbatim code environments.

First we
compile the DocOnce source to the ``ptex2tex`` format, and then we compile
the ``ptex2tex`` format to standard LaTeX.
The `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`__ format can be
viewed as an extended LaTeX. For DocOnce users, the ``ptex2tex`` format
essentially means that the file consists of

1. ``if-else`` statements for the ``preprocess`` processor such that
   LaTeX constructions can be activated or deactivated, and

2. all code environments can be typeset according to a ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
   configuration file.

Point 2 is only of interest if you aim to use a special computer code
formatting that requires you to use a configuration file and
the ``ptex2tex`` program.

The reason for generating ``ptex2tex`` and not standard LaTeX directly
from DocOnce was that the ``ptex2tex`` format shows a range of possible
LaTeX constructions for controlling the layout. It can be instructive
for LaTeX users to look at this code before choosing specific parts
for some desired layout. Experts may also want to edit this code
(which should be automated by a script such that the edits can be
repeated when the DocOnce source is modified, see Step 2b below).
(Direct control of the LaTeX layout in the ``doconce format`` program
would not spit out alternative LaTeX constructs as is now done through
the ``ptex2tex`` step.)

Going from ``ptex2tex`` format to standard LaTeX format is enabled by
either the ``ptex2tex`` program or DocOnce's (simplified) version of it:
``doconce ptex2tex``.


.. admonition:: Inline verbatim tries to use ``texttt`` and not ``Verb`` if possible

   Inline verbatim
   code, typeset with backticks in DocOnce, is translated to
   
   .. code-block:: text
   
           \Verb!text!
   
   or similar constructions with other delimiters if the pipe is used in ``text``.
   Thereafter, if ``text`` does not contain illegal characters for the ``\texttt``
   command, the latter is used instead since then LaTeX can insert
   linebreaks in the inline verbatim text and hence avoid overfull hboxes.




.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filter the doconce text directly to valid LaTeX using
the ``--latex_code_style=`` option:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pdflatex mydoc --latex_code_style=vrb

Without ``--latex_code_style=``, the output will be a ``mydoc.p.tex`` file
that has to be converted to a standard ``mydoc.tex`` LaTeX file via
the programs ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``.

Newcommands
~~~~~~~~~~~

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section :ref:`newcommands`).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

Output for paper vs screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An option ``--device=paper`` makes some adjustments for documents
aimed at being printed. For example, links to web resources are
associated with a footnote listing the complete web address (URL).
(Very long URLs in footnotes can be shortened using services such
as `<http://goo.gl/>`_, `<http://tinyurl.com/>`_, and
`<https://bitly.com/>`_.)
The default, ``--device=screen``, creates a PDF file for reading
on a screen where links are just clickable.

.. index:: LaTeX style options

Command-line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many additional options (run ``doconce format --help`` and
look for options starting with ``--latex`` to get a more verbose description):

 * ``--latex_code_style=lst,vrb,pyg``

 * ``--latex_font=helvetica,palatino``

 * ``--latex_papersize=a4,a6``

 * ``--latex_bibstyle=plain`` (name of BibTeX style)

 * ``--latex_title_layout=titlepage, std, beamer, doconce_heading, Springer_collection``

 * ``--latex_style=std, Springer_sv, Springer_lncse, Springer_llncs, Springer_lnup, Springer_T2, Springer_T4, siamltex, siamltexmm, elsevier``

 * ``--latex_packages=package1,package2,package3`` (list of extra packages to be included [#varioref]_)

 * ``--draft`` (turns on draft mode in documentclass, otherwise final mode)

 * ``--latex_copyright=everypage,titlepages`` (copyright on every page or on titlepage and chapter pages)

 * ``--latex_list_of_exercises=loe,toc,none`` (LaTeX list of exercises, integrated into the table of contents, or no list)

 * ``--latex_fancy_header`` (chapter/section headings at top of pages, style depends on value of ``--latex_section_headings``)

 * ``--latex_section_headings=std,blue,strongblue,gray,gray-wide`` (standard LaTeX, blue headings, strong blue headings, white in gray box, white in gray box that fills the page width)

 * ``--latex_table_format=quote, center, footnotesize, tiny`` (environment around tables)

 * ``--latex_colored_table_rows=blue, gray, no`` (color of every two lines in tables)

 * ``--latex_todonotes`` (inline comments typeset as "bubbles")

 * ``--latex_double_spacing`` (to ease hand-writing between the lines)

 * ``--latex_line_numbers`` (to ease references to sentences)

 * ``--latex_labels_in_margin`` (name of section, equation, citation labels in the margin)

 * ``--latex_preamble=filename`` (user-specific preamble)

 * ``--latex_admon=mdfbox, graybox2, grayicon, yellowicon, paragraph, colors1, colors2``

 * ``--latex_admon_color=0.34,0.02,0.8`` (background color in admons)

 * ``--latex_admon_envir_map=2`` (code environment names in admons)

 * ``--exercise_numbering=absolute, chapter``

 * ``--latex_movie=media9, href, multimedia, movie15`` (control typesetting of movies)

 * ``--latex_movie_controls=on``

 * ``--latex_external_movie_viewer`` (for ``movie15`` package)

 * ``--xelatex`` (prepare for XeLaTeX)

The overall LaTeX style is much governed by ``--latex_title_layout`` and
``--latex_style``.  For the former, ``titlepage`` gives a separate title
page; ``std`` is just standard LaTeX handling of title, author, and
date; ``doconce_heading`` is a more modern heading,
``Springer_collection`` is used with ``--latex_style=Springer_lncse`` for
an edited book; ``beamer`` is needed if the DocOnce document is to be
translated to LaTeX Beamer slides. For ``--latex_style``, ``std`` gives
standard LaTeX behavior; ``Springer_lncse`` is for Springer's LNCSE book
series style (to be used with
``--latex_title_layout=Springer_collection`` if the book is an edited
book); ``Springer_llncs`` is for Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series (normally an edited book that also requres
``--latex_title_layout=Springer_collection``); ``Springer_lnup`` for
Springer's Lecture Notes for Undergraduate Physics books,
``Springer_T2`` for Springer's T2 book layout, ``siamltex``, for the LaTeX
style of papers in standard SIAM journals (also used far beyond SIAM
journals and requires the stylefiles ``siamltex.cls`` and ``siam10.clo``),
``siamltexmm`` for the new multimedia SIAM journal style (requires
``siamltex.cls`` and ``siam10.clo``), ``elsevier`` for the style of papers
to be submitted to Elsevier journals (``--latex_elsevier_journal=`` can
be used to set the journal name, and the style requires
``elsarticle.cls`` and ``elsarticle-num.bst``).

.. [#varioref] Listing ``varioref`` in as package
   automatically leads to references with page numbers, if the element referred to
   is not on the same page. This is often very helpful, e.g., "see
   Figure 5.3 on page 67".

.. index:: LaTeX syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The style of verbatim blocks of computer code is specified by
``--latex_code_style=X``, where ``X`` can be set in a very flexible way.
There are three main values, corresponding to three LaTeX tools
for verbatim type setting:

 * ``vrb`` for plain ``Verbatim`` style (``fancyvrb`` LaTeX package)

 * ``pyg`` for the Pygments style (``mintex`` LaTeX package)

 * ``lst`` for the Listings styles (``listingsutf8`` LaTeX package)

A separate `demo <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/latexcode/demo.html>`__ explains
the many possible settings of ``X``. Popular choices are minimalistic
plain verbatim,

.. code-block:: text

        --latex_code_style=vrb

maybe with an added light blue background color,

.. code-block:: text

        --latex_code_style=vrb-blue1

or the default Pygments style,

.. code-block:: text

        --latex_code_style=pyg

or the Listings-based style with yellow background color

.. code-block:: text

        --latex_code_style=lst-yellow2

It is easy to specify different styles for different code environments, say
blue background with plain verbatim style for code but a special terminal
window for the ``sys`` environment:

.. code-block:: text

        "--latex_code_style=default:vrb-blue1@
        sys:vrb[frame=lines,label=\\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},
        framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}]"

(but no linebreaks, as here, they are for formatting this document only).

Drafts
~~~~~~

During development of a manuscript, may prefer line numbers, double line spacing, frequent use of inline comments, and label names printed in the margin.
This is enabled by the options ``--latex_line_numbers --latex_double_spacing --latex_todonotes --latex_labels_in_margin``. One may also (automatically) edit the
``final`` argument in the ``documentclass`` heading to ``draft`` as this will
mark overful lines (hboxes).

Potential problems with ampersand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another useful option for LaTeX documents is ``--no_ampersand_quote``, which
prevents ampersands from getting a backskash. This is necessary if one
inserts native latex code for tables
inside ``% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex'):`` (or similar ``preprocess`` syntax)
tests.

Part 2 of Step 1 (outdated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you *did not* specify the ``--latex_code_style=`` option,
you must run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have installed the
Python ptex2tex package) to make a standard LaTeX file,

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

If you do not have ``ptex2tex``, or do not bother to make the required
configuration file for ``ptex2tex`` (you may of course rely on the default
file), a (simplified) version of ``ptex2tex``
that comes with DocOnce can be run:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc

The ``ptex2tex`` command can set two preprocessor variables:

 * ``PREAMBLE`` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere - and note that
   the preamble is only included
   if the document has a title, author, and date)

 * ``MINTED`` for inclusion of the minted package for typesetting of
   code with the Pygments tool (which requires ``latex``
   or ``pdflatex`` to be run with the ``-shell-escape`` option); not used
   for ``doconce ptex2tex`` only in the ``ptex2tex`` program

If you are not satisfied with the generated DocOnce preamble, you can provide
your own preamble by adding the command-line option ``--latex_preamble=myfile``.
In case ``myfile`` contains a documentclass definition, DocOnce assumes
that the file contains the *complete* preamble you want (not that all
the packages listed in the default preamble are required and must be
present in ``myfile``). Otherwise, ``myfile`` is assumed to contain
*additional* LaTeX code to be added to the DocOnce default preamble.

The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer code in LaTeX documents. After
any ``!bc`` command in the DocOnce source you can insert verbatim block
styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file, e.g., ``!bc sys`` for a
terminal session, where ``sys`` is set to a certain environment in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeTerminal``).  There are about 40 styles to
choose from, and you can easily add new ones.

The ``doconce ptex2tex`` allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc \ 
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \ 
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that ``@`` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as ``minted``
above, which implies ``\begin{minted}{fortran}`` and ``\end{minted}`` as
begin and end for blocks inside ``!bc fpro`` and ``!ec``).  Specifying
``envir=ans:nt`` means that all other environments are typeset with the
``anslistings.sty`` package, e.g., ``!bc cppcod`` will then result in
``\begin{c++}``. A predefined shortcut as in ``shcod=Verbatim-0.85``
results in denser
vertical spacing (baselinestretch 0.85 in LaTeX terminology), and
``shcod=Verbatim-indent`` implies indentation of the verbatim text.
Alternatively, one can provide all desired parameters
``\begin{Verbatim}`` instruction using the syntax illustrated for
the ``sys`` environments above.

If no environments like ``sys``, ``fpro``, or the common
``envir`` are defined on the command line, the plain ``\begin{Verbatim}``
and ``\end{Verbatim}`` instructions are used.

.. _do2any:latex:compile2:

From DocOnce to LaTeX-PDF: Edit the LaTeX File (Step 2, Optional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can *edit* the ``mydoc.tex`` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute ``section`` by ``section*`` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst``
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
You will use ``doconce replace`` to edit ``section{`` to ``section*{``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex

For fixing the line break of a title, you may pick a word in the
title, say "Using", and insert a break after than word. With
``doconce subst`` this is easy employing regular expressions with
a group before "Using" and a group after:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \ 
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file so the ``doconce subst`` or
``doconce replace`` commands can be put inside the script.

.. _do2any:latex:compile3:

From DocOnce to LaTeX-PDF: Generate PDF (Step 3)
------------------------------------------------

Compile ``mydoc.tex`` and create the PDF file, using ``pdflatex``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pdflatex mydoc
        Terminal> pdflatex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibtex mydoc      # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex mydoc

One can also compile ``mydoc`` the "old way" with ``latex`` and ``dvipdf``.
Use ``doconce format latex`` in that case and proceed with ``latex mydoc``.

If the minted style is used, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, or ``xelatex``
*must* be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibtex mydoc      # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc

.. _do2any:xelatex:

XeLaTeX
-------

.. index::
   single: output format; XeLaTeX

.. index:: XeLaTeX output

XeLaTeX is an alternative to pdfLaTeX and is run in almost the
same way, except for the ``--xelatex`` flag to ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pdflatex mydoc --xelatex \ 
                  --latex_code_style=lst
        Terminal> xelatex mydoc

.. _do2any:epub:

From PDF to e-book formats
--------------------------

.. index:: ePub output

.. index::
   single: output format; ePub

PDF (as generated from LaTeX above) can be read on most devices today.
However, for Kindle and other devices specialized for e-books you
need to convert to their format. The `Calibre <http://calibre-ebook.com/>`__
program can produce epub, mobi, and other e-book formats from PDF,
see a `description <http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/latex-lyx-e-books.html>`__.

.. _do2any:MS:ooffice:

Microsoft Word or LibreOffice
-----------------------------

.. index::
   single: output format; MS Word

.. index::
   single: output format; LibreOffice

.. index::
   single: output format; OpenOffice

Transforming DocOnce files to Word format is best done with the aid
of ``pandoc``. A standard way is to first generate the Markdown format
(``doconce format pandoc``) and then use ``pandoc`` to generate a ``.docx``
file:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.md

The transformation works well for simple text files, but LaTeX mathematics
does not work.

.. _do2any:ipynb:

Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks
---------------------------

.. index::
   single: output format; notebook

.. index:: IPython notebook

.. index:: Jupyter notebook

.. index:: notebook

DocOnce can generate json files for the Jupyter Notebook:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format ipynb mydoc  # results in mydoc.ipynb

Hidden code blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is no guarantee that the notebook can be executed. For example,
having the code

.. code-block:: python

        print sys.version

will not execute unless ``sys`` is imported. While a book may show such
code and skip (potentially tedious) initializing statements, they must
be present in the notebook. To this end, use the ``!bc *hid`` environment
for hidden code. In the present example, we use ``!bc pyhid`` to specify
Python code that needs to be executed, but that should normally be
hidden (other formats, with the exception of certain interactive Sphinx
documents, will hide such code).

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pyhid
        import sys
        !ec

The notebook will feature the ``import sys`` statement in a cell prior to the
``print sys.version`` cell, and the latter will work.

Similarly, if you import from your own modules, say ``from mymod import hello``,
the ``mymod.py`` must be accessible for the notebook. Suppose this file
is in ``src-test/mymod.py``. Then you need to add ``src-test`` to ``sys.path``
for the import statement to work:

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pyhid
        sys.path.append('src-test')
        !ec

Displaying code as plain text instead of executable cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some code blocks may just be there for explanation and are not
meant to be executed. These can be marked by ``!bc pycod-t`` (or
``!bc Xcod-t`` for any supported programming language ``X``):

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pycod-t
        if isinstance(myvar, float):
            raise TypeError('myvar must be array, not %s' % type(myvar))
        !ec

The code segment above will then be typeset as verbatim text and not
an executable cell, and there is no need to worry about a missing
definition of ``myvar`` (which would cause problems in an executable cell).

Interactive sessions with the ``pyshell`` or ``ipy`` environment will
by default be broken up into many cells such that each output command
ends a cell. By executing the cells, the input *and* output from the
session is recovered. This is usually the behavior that is wanted, but
there is an option ``--ipynb_split_pyshell=off`` that can be used to
typeset the entire session with all input but no output in one cell
(``print`` statements will lead to output, but plain dumping of
a variable will not lead to output like it does in a Python shell).

To have an interactive session typeset with input and output in plain
text, use the ``-t`` extension to the environment: ``pyshell-t`` and ``ipy-t``.

Figures
~~~~~~~

As with HTML files, you need to ensure that the notebook has access to
figures and source code as requested.

Figures in notebooks can be typeset in various ways, specified by
the ``--ipynb_figure=`` option, with the following values:

 * ``md``: plain Markdown syntax for a figure, with no possibility to adjust
   the size (default)

 * ``imgtag``: ``<img ...>`` tag in HTML taking the specified width into account

 * ``Image``: Python notebook cell with ``Image`` object

Movies
~~~~~~

Typesetting of movies is specified by ``--ipynb_movie=``, and valid options
are

 * ``md``: raw HTML code with ``iframe`` tag - not relevant for the notebook

 * ``HTML``: raw HTML code with ``iframe`` tag
    embedded in the ``HTML`` object from the notebook (default)

 * ``HTML-YouTube``: as ``HTML`` but use an ``IPython.display.YouTubeVideo``
   object to display YouTube videos

 * ``ipynb``: use ``IPython.display.YouTubeVideo`` object for YouTube videos,
   and use an ``HTML`` object with ``video`` tag for local movies

Admonitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Typesetting of admonition is rather primitive in notebooks.
We offer these different choices, set by the
option ``--ipynb_admon=``:

 * ``quote``: typeset admon as Markdown quote (special font and gray vertical bar on
   the left)

 * ``paragraph``: typeset admon as a plain paragraph with a heading if any (default)

 * ``hrule``: use a horozontal rule to surround the heading and the text

Note that quotes in ``!bc quote`` environments
are always typeset as Markdown quotes.

References to an External Textbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes one wants to refer to equations and sections in an external
LaTeX book where a ``book.aux`` file is available. The references in the
notebook to the LaTeX book can then be hardcoded from the ``book.aux`` file
with this construction:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format ipynb mydoc \ 
                  --replace_ref_by_latex_auxno=book.aux

.. _do2any:matlabnb:

Matlab Notebooks
----------------

.. index::
   single: output format; notebook

.. index:: Matlab notebook

.. index:: Matlab publish format (notebook)

.. index:: notebook

The Matlab *publish* format is aimed at notebooks, but the markup is
quite primitive, so only a small subset of DocOnce markup can translate
successfully to the Matlab publish format. However, if you write within
that subset, it is easy to create notebooks in DocOnce that can translate
both to Python and Matlab (use preprocessor directives or Mako functions
to include Matlab or Python code, depending on the output format).

The Matlab publish format is called ``matlabnb``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format matlabnb mydoc

The ``--replace_ref_by_latex_auxno=`` option for referring to equations
and sections in a textbook, as explained at the end of the section on
Jupyter/IPython notebooks, also works with Matlab notebooks (and for
any other output format):

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format matlabnb mydoc \ 
                  --replace_ref_by_latex_auxno=book.aux

.. _do2any:ascii:

Plain ASCII Text
----------------

.. index::
   single: output format; ASCII

.. index::
   single: output format; plain untagged text

.. index:: ASCII output

.. index:: plain untagged text output

We can go from DocOnce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt

.. _do2any:rst:

reStructuredText
----------------

.. index::
   single: output format; reStructuredText

.. index:: reStructuredText output

Going from DocOnce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the DocOnce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program ``unovonv``
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
``mydoc.odt`` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt

**Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.**
At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from DocOnce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by ``latex`` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the ``sphinx`` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

.. _do2any:sphinx:

Sphinx
------

.. index::
   single: output format; Sphinx

.. index:: Sphinx output

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \ 
                  theme=sometheme mydoc short_title="short title" mydoc

The author, title, and copyright information needed by Sphinx is
taken from the DocOnce file ``mydoc.do.txt``.
By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and
``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``classic``).

One often just runs the simple command

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

which creates the Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake_sphinx.py`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  Run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python automake_sphinx.py

As the output also tells, you can see the Sphinx HTML version of the document
by running

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> google-chrome sphinx-rootdir/_build/html/index.html

or loading the ``index.html`` file manually into your favorite web browser.

If you cycle through editing the DocOnce file and watching the
HTML output, you should observe that ``automake_sphinx.py`` does not
recompile the DocOnce file if the Sphinx ``.rst`` version already exists.
In each edit-and-watch cycle do

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> rm mydoc.rst; python automake_sphinx.py


.. admonition:: Tip

   If you are new
   to Sphinx and end up producing quite some Sphinx documents, you are encouraged
   to read the Sphinx documentation and study the ``automake_sphinx.py``
   file. Maybe you want to do things differently.




The following paragraphs describes the many possibilities for steering
the Sphinx output.

**Links.**
The ``automake_sphinx.py`` script copies directories named ``fig*``
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  It also examines ``MOVIE:`` and ``FIGURE:``
commands in the DocOnce file to find other image files and copies
these too. I strongly recommend to put files
to which there are local links (not ``http:`` or ``file:`` URLs) in
a directory named ``_static``. The ``automake_sphinx.py`` copies
``_static*`` to the Sphinx directory, which guarantees that the links
to the local files will work in the Sphinx document.

There is a utility ``doconce sphinxfix_localURLs`` for checking links to
local files and moving the files to ``_static`` and changing the links
accordingly. For example, a link to ``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` is changed
to ``_static/myfile.txt`` and ``myfile.txt`` is copied to ``_static``.
However, I recommend instead that you manually copy
files to ``_static`` when you want to link to them, or let your
script which compiles the DocOnce document do it automatically.

.. index:: Sphinx styles

**Themes.**
DocOnce comes with a rich collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents,
much larger than what is found in the standard Sphinx distribution.
Additional themes include
``agni``,
``alabaster``,
``basic``,
``basicstrap``,
``bootstrap``,
``cloud``,
``epub``,
``fenics``,
``fenics_minimal``,
``flask``,
``haiku``,
``jal``,
``pylons``,
``pyramid``,
``redcloud``,
``scipy_lectures``,
``scrolls``,
``slim-agogo``,
``sphinx_rtd_theme``,
and
``vlinux-theme``.
Some of the themes come with basic Sphinx, while others must be installed
separately, see the ``bundled/README_sphinx_themes.do.txt`` file in
the DocOnce source code tree for installation instructions.

.. index:: conf.py (Sphinx configuration)

The
``doconce sphinx_dir`` insert lots of extra code in the ``conf.py``
file to enable easy specification of information and,
in particular,customization of themes.
For example, modules are loaded for the additional themes that
come with DocOnce, code is inserted to allow customization of
the look and feel of themes, etc. The ``conf.py`` file is a
good starting point for fine-tuning your favorite theme, and your
own ``myconf.py`` file can later be supplied and used when running
``doconce sphinx_dir``: simply add the command-line option
``conf.py=myconf.py``.

A script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics``, ``pyramid``, and ``pylon`` one writes

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid pylon

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!). With ``make-themes.sh``
it is easy to check out various themes to find the one that is most
attractive for your document.

You may supply your own theme and avoid copying all the themes
that come with DocOnce into the Sphinx directory. Just specify
``theme_dir=path`` on the command line, where ``path`` is the relative
path to the directory containing the Sphinx theme. You must also
specify a configure file by ``conf.py=path``, where ``path`` is the
relative path to your ``conf.py`` file.

**Example.**
Say you like the ``scipy_lectures`` theme, but you want
a table of contents to appear *to the right*, much in the same style
as in the ``default`` or ``classic`` themes
(where the table of contents is to the left).
You can then run ``doconce sphinx_dir``, invoke a text editor with the
``conf.py`` file, find the line ``html_theme == 'scipy_lectures'``,
edit the following ``nosidebar`` to ``false`` and ``rightsidebar`` to ``true``.
Alternatively, you may write a little script using ``doconce replace``
to replace a portion of text in ``conf.py`` by a new one:

.. code-block:: bash

        doconce replace "elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
            html_theme_options = {
                'nosidebar': 'true',
                'rightsidebar': 'false',
                'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
                'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
                'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
                'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
                'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
            }" "elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
            html_theme_options = {
                'nosidebar': 'false',
                'rightsidebar': 'true',
                'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
                'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
                'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
                'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
                'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
            }" conf.py

Obviously, we could also have changed colors in the edit above.
The final alternative is to save the edited ``conf.py`` file somewhere
and reuse it the next time ``doconce sphinx_dir`` is run

.. code-block:: text

        doconce sphinx_dir theme=scipy_lectures \ 
                           conf.py=../some/path/conf.py mydoc

**RunestoneInteractive books.**
The ``doconce format sphinx`` command accepts an option ``--runestone``
for generating `RunestoneInteractive <http://runestoneinteractive.org>`__
books (which build on Sphinx).
You must run the generated ``automake_sphinx.py`` also with a ``--runestone``
option to generate these type of documents.

.. index:: Sphinx directory

The manual Sphinx procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

**Step 1.**
Translate DocOnce into the Sphinx format:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc

**Step 2.**
Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

.. code-block:: text

        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated ``conf.py`` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` generator makes an extended ``conv.py``
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.

**Step 3.**
Copy the ``mydoc.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.
Links to local files in ``mydoc.rst`` must be modified to links to
files in the ``_static`` directory, see comment above.

**Step 4.**
Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes

.. code-block:: text

        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

**Step 5.**
Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

.. code-block:: text

        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with ``index.html`` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

**Step 6.**
View the result:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

.. _do2any:wiki:

Wiki Formats
------------

.. index::
   single: output format; MediaWiki

.. index::
   single: output format; Creole wiki

.. index::
   single: output format; Google wiki

.. index:: MediaWiki output

.. index:: Google wiki output

.. index:: Creole wiki output

.. index:: wiki output

There are many different wiki formats, but DocOnce only supports three:
`Googlecode wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`__,
`MediaWiki <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting>`__, and
`Creole Wiki <http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0>`__.
These formats are called
``gwiki``, ``mwiki``, and ``cwiki``, respectively.
Transformation from DocOnce to these formats is done by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt

The produced MediaWiki can be tested in the `sandbox of
wikibooks.org <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sandbox>`__. The format
works well with Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and
`ShoutWiki <http://doconcedemo.shoutwiki.com/wiki/DocOnce_demo_page>`__,
but not always well elsewhere
(see `this example <http://doconcedemo.jumpwiki.com/wiki/First_demo>`__).

Large MediaWiki documents can be made with the
`Book creator <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator>`__.
From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of `mwlib <http://pediapress.com/code/>`__. This means that one can
easily use DocOnce to write `Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org>`__
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format, while
at the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book, a Sphinx web document, or a collection of HTML files.

The Googlecode wiki document, ``mydoc.gwiki``, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser. Note that Google decided to close down its
Googlecode service in 2015.

When the DocOnce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the ``.gwiki`` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

.. _do2any:google:docs:

Google Docs
-----------

.. index:: Google docs output

Google Docs are normally made online in the interactive editor. However,
you may upload a DocOnce document to Google Docs. This requires transforming
the DocOnce document to one of the accepted formats for Google Docs:

 * OpenOffice: ``doconce format rst`` and then run
   ``rst2odt`` (or ``rst2odt.py``). Upload the ``.odt`` file, click
   *Open...* in Google Drive and choose *Google Docs* as viewer.

 * MS Word: ``doconce format pandoc`` and then run ``pandoc`` to
   produce a ``.docx`` file that can be uploaded to Google Drive
   and opened in Google Docs.

 * RTF: ``doconce format pandoc`` and then run ``pandoc`` to produce
   a ``.rtf`` file that can be uploaded to Google Drive and opened.
   Another possibility is to run ``doconce format latex`` and
   then `latex2rtf <http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf>`__
   (the support of mathematics has gotten worse).

 * Plain text: ``doconce format plain``. Upload the ``.txt`` file
   to Google Drive and open in Google Docs.

 * HTML: ``doconce format html``. Upload the ``.html`` file and
   open in Google Docs. Complicated HTML files can be misinterpreted
   by Google Docs.

This is not yet much tested. It remains to see how code becomes in
Google Docs. Support for mathematics is probably impossible until
Google Docs can import LaTeX files, but LaTeX mathematics can be embedded
in Google Docs and the `googledoc2latex <http://code.google.com/p/googledoc2latex>`__ script can convert a Google document to LaTeX.

.. _do2any:tweaking:

Tweaking the DocOnce Output
---------------------------

.. index:: tweaking output

.. index:: automatic editing

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from DocOnce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
DocOnce to reStructuredText. Since DocOnce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from DocOnce. It is then wise to run DocOnce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from DocOnce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

Options for the ``doconce`` commands
====================================

``doconce format`` command-line options
---------------------------------------

        plain, blueish, blueish2, bloodish, tactile-black, tactile-red, rossant
        solarized, solarized2_light, solarized2_dark,
        bootstrap, bootswatch,
        bootstrap_X,  X=bloodish, blue, bluegray, brown, cbc, FlatUI, red,
        bootswatch_X, X=cerulean, cosmo, flatly, journal, lumen, readable,
                        simplex, spacelab, united, yeti
                        (dark:) amelia, cyborg, darkly, slate, spruce,

        --no_title
        
        Comment out TITLE, AUTHOR, DATE.
        Often used with HTML templates.
        
        
        --html_code_style=...
        
        off, inherit, or transparent: enable normal inline verbatim font
        where foreground and background color is inherited from the
        surroundnings (e.g., to avoid the red Boostrap color).
        Default: on (use the css-specified typesetting of <pre> tags).
        NOTE: the naming "html_code_style" is not optimal: it has nothing
        to do with code block style, but the <code> tag for inline verbatim text
        in the context of bootstrap css styles.
        
        
        
        --html_pre_style=...
        
        off, inherit, or transparent: let code blocks inside <pre> tags have
        foreground and background color inherited from the surroundnings.
        Default: on (use the css-specified typesetting of <pre> tags).
        This option is most relevant for Bootstrap styles to
        avoid white background in code blocks inside colorful admons.
        
        
        
        --html_toc_depth=...
        
        No of levels in the table of contents in HTML output. Default: 2 (includes subsections but not subsubsections).
        
        
        --html_toc_indent=...
        
        No of spaces for indentation of subsections in the table of
        contents in HTML output. Default: 3 (0 gives toc as nested list
        in Bootstrap-based styles).
        
        
        --html_body_font=...
        
        Specify HTML font for text body. =? lists available fonts.
        
        
        --html_heading_font=...
        
        Specify HTML font for headings. =? lists available fonts.
        
        
        --html_video_autoplay=...
        
        True for autoplay when HTML is loaded, otherwise False (default).
        
        
        --html_admon=...
        
        Type of admonition and color:
        colors, gray, yellow, apricot, lyx, paragraph.
        For html_style=bootstrap*,bootswatch*,
        the two legal values are boostrap_panel, bootstrap_alert.
        
        
        --html_admon_shadow
        
        Add a shadow effect to HTML admon boxes (gray, yellow, apricot).
        
        
        --html_admon_bg_color=...
        
        Background color of admon in HTML.
        
        
        --html_admon_bd_color=...
        
        Boundary color of admon in HTML.
        
        
        --css=...

        in Safari and Chrome and can use rawgit.com.
        
        Values of --html_raw_github_url=:
        safe or cdn.rawgit: use this for ready-made sites with potentially some traffic.

        --latex_admon=...
        
        Type of admonition in LaTeX:
        colors1:
        (inspired by the NumPy User Guide) applies different colors
        for the different admons with an embedded icon,
        
        colors2:
        like `colors1` but the text is wrapped around the icon,
        
        mdfbox:
        rounded boxes with a optional title and no icon (default),
        
        graybox2:
        box with square corners, gray background, and narrower
        than mdfbox, if code it reduces to something like mdfbox
        (mdframed based); the summary admon is in case of A4 format
        only half of the text width with text wrapped around
        (effective for proposals and articles),
        
        grayicon:
        box with gray icons and a default light gray background,
        
        yellowicon:
        box yellow icons and a default light yellow background,
        
        paragraph:  plain paragraph with boldface heading.
        
        Note: the colors in mdfbox and other boxes can customized.
        
        
        
        --latex_admon_color=...
        
        The color to be used as background in admonitions.
        A single value applies to all admons:
        Either rgb tuple or saturated color a la yellow!5:
          --latex_admon_color=0.1,0.1,0.4
          '--latex_admon_color=yellow!5'
        Note the quotes, needed for bash, in the latter example.
        
        Multiple values can be assigned, one for each admon (all admons must
        be specified):
          '--latex_admon_color=warning:darkgreen!40!white;notice:darkgray!20!white;summary:tucorange!20!white;question:red!50!white;block:darkgreen!40!white'
        
        If --latex_admon=mdfbox, the specification above with color1!X!color2
        will automatically trigger 2*X as the background color of the frametitle.
        
        There are predefined multiple values, e.g.,
          --latex_admon_color=colors1
        gives red warnings, blue notice, orange questions, green summaries and
        yellow blocks, automatically adjusted with darker frametitles for
        
        If --latex_admon=mdfbox, the background of the title and
        the color of the border of box can also be customized by
        direct editing. For example, a dark blue border and light
        blue title background is obtained by editing the .tex file as
        
        doconce replace 'linecolor=black,' 'linecolor=darkblue,' mydoc.tex
        doconce subst 'frametitlebackgroundcolor=.*?,' 'frametitlebackgroundcolor=blue!5,' mydoc.tex
        
        Actually, this particular (and common) edit is automatically done by the option
          --latex_admon_color=bluestyle
          --latex_admon_color=yellowstyle
        (the latter has color yellow!5 instead and yellow!20 for the border)
        
        
        
        --latex_admon_title_no_period
        
        By default, a period is added to title admons that do not have a period, question mark, or similar. This option prevents adding a period such that the title acts like a heading.
        
        
        --latex_admon_envir_map=...
        
        Mapping of code envirs to new envir names inside admons, e.g.,
        to get a different code typesetting inside admons. This is useful
        if admons have a special color and the color background of code
        blocks does not fit will with the color background inside admons.
        Then it is natural to use a different verbatim code style inside
        admons.
        If specifying a number, say 2, as in --latex_admon_envir_map=2,
        an envir like pycod gets the number appended: pycod2. One can
        then in --latex_code_style= or in doconce ptex2tex or ptex2tex
        specify the typesetting of pycod2 environments.
        Otherwise the specification must be a mapping for each envir
        that should be changed inside the admons:
        --latex_admon_envir_map=pycod-pycod_yellow,fpro-fpro2
        (from-to,from-to,... syntax).
        
        
        --latex_subex_header_postfix=...
        
        Default: ).
        Gives headers a), b), etc. Can be set to period, colon, etc.
        
        
        --xelatex
        
        Use xelatex instead of latex/pdflatex.
        
        
        --latex_double_hyphen
        
        Replace single dash - by double dash -- in LaTeX output.
        Somewhat intelligent, but may give unwanted edits. Use with great care!

        on, True, yes: split (default).
        off, False, no: do not split.
        Note that pyshell-t and ipy-t environments just displays the session,
        while default pyshell and ipy removes all output (all output from print
        statements will come after the entire session).

        makes sense in a Sphinx Table of Contents if one wants to split
        the document into multiple parts.
        
        
        --oneline_paragraphs
        
        Combine paragraphs to one line (does not work well).
        

Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a DocOnce format stored in the file

.. code-block:: text

        doc/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file ``make.sh`` in the ``tutorial`` directory of the
DocOnce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, ``tutorial.do.txt`` is the
starting point.  Running ``make.sh`` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original ``tutorial.do.txt`` file,
gives a quick introduction to how DocOnce is used in a real case.

There is another demo in the ``docs/manual`` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, ``manual.do.txt``, to
various formats. The ``make.sh`` script runs a set of translations.

Installation of DocOnce and its Dependencies
============================================

.. index:: installation

Below, we explain the manual installation of all software that may be
needed when working with DocOnce documents.
The impatient way to install everything that is needed is to use
Anaconda Python and the ``conda`` program:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> conda install --channel johannr doconce

The ``conda`` package is available for Mac and Linux only.

If you do not want to use Anaconda and are
on a Debian-based Linux
computer (running, e.g., Ubuntu), you can instead run the Bash script
`install_doconce.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/manual/install_doconce.sh>`__ or the equivalent Python script
`install_doconce.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/manual/install_doconce.py>`__.
These scripts gives a comprehensive installation. Some users will prefer to
install just what is needed for them, and this is explained below.


.. admonition:: Version control systems are needed

   The coming installation instructions require that the version control systems
   Subversion, Mercurial, and Git are installed on your computer.





.. admonition:: What about Mac and Windows

   DocOnce is primarily tested on GNU/Debian Linux systems, but also to
   a minor extent on Mac OS X. Experience with Windows is limited.
   Since most packages are Python-based and can be installed via ``pip install``
   no problems should arise on Mac and Windows. However, some of the
   image processing tools and spell checking apply Unix-specific software.




You can omit reading the next sections if you rely on ``conda`` or
``apt-get install`` commands in the Bash script for installing DocOnce.

DocOnce
-------

DocOnce itself is pure Python code hosted at `<https://github.com/hplgit/doconce>`_.
Installation can be done via

.. code-block:: text

        sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/hplgit/doconce#egg=doconce
        # or if doconce is already installed
        sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/hplgit/doconce#egg=doconce --upgrade

However, the recommended approach is to have a copy of the source on
the local computer and run ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: text

        git clone git@github.com:hplgit/doconce.git
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since DocOnce is frequently updated, it becomes necessary to ensure
that you work with the most recent version:

.. code-block:: text

        cd doconce
        git pull origin master
        sudo python setup.py install

Dependencies
------------

Producing HTML documents, plain text, pandoc-extended Markdown,
and wikis can be done without installing any other
software. However, if you want other formats as output
(LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText) and assisting utilities such
as preprocesors, spellcheck, file differences, bibliographies,
and so on, a lot of extra software must be installed.

Python v2.7
~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need Python version 2.7 and the ``pip`` installation program.
Unless you already have these, we recommend to install a comprehensive
Python bundle like `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`__.

You do not need more software if you avoid using preprocessors, there
is no bibliography, and you stick to the output formats LaTeX and HTML
(you need of course LaTeX installed to process ``.tex`` files).

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`__
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

.. code-block:: text

        pip install -e svn+http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk#egg=preprocess

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`__. Its installation is done by

.. code-block:: text

        pip install Mako

Note that neither Preprocess nor Mako is run if you do not have
preprocessor directives in your DocOnce source. That is, you only need
this extra software if you make active use of preprocessors.

Bibliography
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python package `Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`__ is needed if you use a bibliography
in your document (``cite`` commands and a ``BIBFILE:`` specification).
The installation is done by

.. code-block:: text

        pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish#egg=publish

Image file handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different output formats require different formats of image files.
For example, PDF or PNG is used for ``pdflatex``,
PostScript for
``latex``, while HTML needs JPEG, GIF, or PNG formats.  DocOnce
calls up programs from the ImageMagick suite for converting image
files to a proper format if needed. The `ImageMagick suite <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>`__ can be installed on all
major platforms.  On Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems one can
simply write

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install imagemagick

The convenience program ``doconce combine_images``, for combining several
images into one, will use ``montage`` and ``convert`` from ImageMagick and
the ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``pdfcrop`` programs from the ``texlive-extra-utils``
Debian package. The latter gets installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install texlive-extra-utils

Automatic image conversion from EPS to PDF calls up ``epstopdf``, which
can be installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install texlive-font-utils

Spellcheck
~~~~~~~~~~

The utility ``doconce spellcheck`` applies the ``ispell`` program for
spellcheck. On Debian (including Ubuntu) it is installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install ispell

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Originally, DocOnce relied on the `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`__ program for very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks. A simplified version, ``doconce ptex2tex``, is bundled
with DocOnce. However, even greater flexibility is now offered by the
``--latex_code_style=`` option to ``doconce format`` so unless you already are
a ``ptex2tex`` user, it is recommended to forget about ``ptex2tex`` and
just use the ``--latex_code_style=`` option.

The stand-alone ``ptex2tex`` program is installed by

.. code-block:: text

        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, ``cp2texmf.sh``:

.. code-block:: text

        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install texlive

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/misc`` directory).

Note that the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command, which needs no installation
beyond DocOnce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ``ptex2tex``
program.

Pygments and the Minted Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *minted* LaTeX style is
popular for typesetting code.
This style requires the package `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`__
to be installed. On Debian Linux, the simplest approach is to
install ``sphinx``:

.. code-block:: text

        pip install sphinx

All use of the minted style requires the ``-shell-escape`` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., ``pdflatex -shell-escape``.

Inline comments apply the ``todonotes`` LaTeX package if the option
``--latex_todonotes`` is given.  The ``todonotes`` package requires
several other packages: ``xcolor``, ``ifthen``, ``xkeyval``, ``tikz``, ``calc``,
``graphicx``, and ``setspace``. The relevant Debian packages for
installing all this are listed below.

LaTeX packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many LaTeX packages are potentially needed, depending on various
constructions in the text and command-line options used when compling DocOnce to
LaTeX. The
standard packages always required are ``relsize``, ``makeidx``,
``setspace``, ``color``, ``amsmath``, ``amsfonts``, ``xcolor``, ``bm``,
``microtype``, ``inputenc``, and ``hyperref``.
Optional packages that might be included in the ``.tex`` output are ``minted``,
``listings``, ``fancyvrb``, ``xunicode``, ``inputenc``, ``helvet``, ``mathpazo``, ``wrapfig``,
``calc``, ``ifthen``, ``xkeyval``, ``tikz``, ``graphicx``, ``setspace``, ``shadow``,
``disable``, ``todonotes``, ``lineno``, ``xr``, ``framed``, ``mdframe``,
``movie15``, ``a4paper``, and ``a6paper``.

Relevant Debian packages that gives you all of these LaTeX packages are

.. code-block:: text

        texlive
        texlive-extra-utils
        texlive-latex-extra
        texlive-font-utils

Alternatively, one may pull in ``texlive-full`` to get all available
style files.

If you want to use the *anslistings* code environment with ``ptex2tex``
(``.ptex2tex.cfg`` styles ``Python_ANS``, ``Python_ANSt``, ``Cpp_ANS``, etc.) or
``doconce ptex2tex`` (``envir=ans`` or ``envir=ans:nt``), you need the
``anslistings.sty`` file. It can be obtained from
the `ptex2tex source <https://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex/source/browse/trunk/latex/styles/with_license/anslistings.sty>`__. The same code style is in
"modern DocOnce" just implemented by the command-line option

.. code-block:: text

        "--latex_code_style=default:lst[style=yellow2_fb]"

Sphinx or reStructuredText Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Output to ``sphinx`` or ``rst`` requires the
`Sphinx software <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`__,
installed by

.. code-block:: text

        pip install sphinx --upgrade

DocOnce comes with many Sphinx themes that are not part of the
standard Sphinx source distribution:

 * cloud and redcloud: `<https://bitbucket.org/ecollins/cloud_sptheme>`_

 * bootstrap: `<https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`_

 * solarized: `<https://bitbucket.org/miiton/sphinxjp.themes.solarized>`_

 * impressjs: `<https://github.com/shkumagai/sphinxjp.themes.impressjs>`_

 * sagecellserver: `<https://github.com/kriskda/sphinx-sagecell>`_

Appropriate installation commands for these themes are

.. code-block:: text

        pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/ecollins/cloud_sptheme#egg=cloud_sptheme
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme#egg=sphinx-bootstrap-theme
        pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/miiton/sphinxjp.themes.solarized#egg=sphinxjp.themes.solarized
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/shkumagai/sphinxjp.themes.impressjs#egg=sphinxjp.themes.impressjs
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/kriskda/sphinx-sagecell#egg=sphinx-sagecell

It can also be handy to have special typesetting of IPython sessions:

.. code-block:: text

        pip install -e git+https://bitbucket.org/hplbit/pygments-ipython-console#egg=pygments-ipython-console

To make OpenOffice or LibreOffice documents from ``rst`` output, you
will need more software, typically the following on a Debian system:

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths

.. There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents

.. using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is

.. `rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>`__. Either download the tarball

.. or clone the svn repository, go to the ``rst2pdf`` directory and

.. run the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.

Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DocOnce format ``pandoc`` outputs the document in various Markdown
versions: the Pandoc
extended Markdown format (which via the ``pandoc`` program can be
translated to a range of other formats), strict Markdown, and
GitHub-flavored Markdown. Installation of `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`__, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install pandoc

on Debian (Ubuntu) systems.

Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is ``epydoc`` one needs that program too, installed
by

.. code-block:: text

        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..

**Remark.**
Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
``apt-get install`` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For ``svn`` directories, go to the directory,
run ``svn update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``. For
Mercurial (``hg``) directories, go to the directory, run
``hg pull; hg update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``.

Analyzing file differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``doconce diff file1 file prog`` command for illustrating differences between
two files ``file1`` and ``file2`` using the program ``prog`` requires ``prog``
to be installed. By default, ``prog`` is ``difflib`` which comes with Python
and is always present if you have DocOnce installed. Another choice, ``diff``,
should be available on all Unix/Linux systems. Other choices, their
URL, and their ``sudo apt-get install`` command on Debian (Ubuntu) systems
appear in the table below.
