DocOnce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jul 20, 2014

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like `LaTeX <http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>`_, `HTML <http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>`_, `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_, `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_, and `wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.

Some DocOnce Features
=====================

 * Strong support for texts with much math and code.

 * Same source can produce a variety of output formats.
   The following support LaTeX math and (pygmentized) code:

  1. `traditional LaTeX B/W documents for printing <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_4printing.pdf>`_

  2. `color LaTeX PDF documents <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.pdf>`_

  3. `color LaTeX PDF documents for viewing on small phones <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_4phone.pdf>`_

  4. `Sphinx HTML documents with 20+ different designs <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/sphinx-fenics_minimal/report.html>`_

  5. `Plain HTML <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.html>`_ or with a `template <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_vagrant.html>`_ or `another template <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_github_minimal.html>`_ or `solarized <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report_solarized.html>`_

  6. HTML for `Google <http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/>`_ or `Wordpress <http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/>`_ blog posts

  7. `MediaWiki <http://doconcedemo.shoutwiki.com/wiki/DocOnce_demo_page>`_ (Wikipedia, Wikibooks, etc)

  8. Markdown

  9. IPython notebook

   Other formats include plain untagged text (for email),
   Creole wiki (for Bitbucket wikis), Google wiki (for Googlecode),
   reStructuredText, and Epytext.

 * Integration with Mako enables use of variables, functions, if-tests,
   and loops to parameterize the text and generate various versions of
   the text for different purposes.

 * Computer code can be copied directly from parts of source code files.

 * Running text can quickly be edited to slide formats (reveal.js and deck.js,
   based on HTML5+CSS3).

 * Special exercise environments with support for hints, answers,
   subexercises, etc.

 * Automatic inline embedding of YouTube and Vimeo movies.

 * Good support for admonitions in various LaTeX and HTML styles
   for warnings, questions, hints, remarks, summaries, etc.

What Does DocOnce Look Like?
============================

DocOnce text looks like ordinary text (much like Markdown), but there
are some almost invisible text constructions that allow you to control
the formating. Here are some examples.

  * Bullet lists automatically arise from lines starting with ``*``,
    or ``o`` if the list is to be enumerated.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by ``*``. **Words in boldface**
    are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in backticks and
    then typeset ``verbatim (in a monospace font)``.

  * Section and paragraph headings are recognied special
    decorating characters (``=`` or ``_``) before and after the heading.
    The length of the decoration determines the level of the
    section.

  * Blocks of computer code are included by surrounding the blocks with
    ``!bc`` (begin code) and ``!ec`` (end code) tags on separate lines.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are included by surrounding the blocks
    with ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and ``!et`` (end TeX) tags on separate lines.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics
    such that formulas make sense also when not rendered by LaTeX
    or MathJax.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
    YouTube and Vimeo videos are automatically embedded in web documents.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Special comment lines are not visible in the output.

  * Comments to authors can be inserted throughout the text and
    made visible or invisible as desired.

  * There is an exercise environment with many advanced features.

  * With a preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include other
    documents (files), large portions of text can be defined in or out
    of the text, and tailored format-specific constructs can easily be
    included. With Mako a single text can output its program examples
    in two or more languages.

What Can DocOnce Be Used For?
-----------------------------

LaTeX is ideal for articles, thesis, and books, but not so suited
for web documents. Nice environments for web documents, such as
Sphinx, Markdown, or plain HTML, are not particularly well
suited for thesis and books. IPython notebooks are ideal for
documenting computational experiments, but do not (yet) meet the
requirements of books and thesis.

What about migrating a part of a book to blog posts? What about making
an MS Word version of parts or an untagged text for inclusion in
email?  What about efficiently generating slides in modern HTML5
style?  DocOnce enables all this with just *one source* (the slogan is
*document once - include anywhere*).
DocOnce also
has many extra features for supporting documents with much code and
mathematics, not found in any of the mentioned formats.

Basic Syntax
------------

Here is an example of some simple text written in the DocOnce format:

.. code-block:: text

        ======= First a Section Heading =======
        
        Section headings have 7 equality characters before and after the heading.
        With 9 characters we have a chapter heading, 5 gives a subsection
        heading, and 3 a subsubsection heading.
        
        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Quotations appear inside double backticks
        and double single quotes, as in ``this example''.
        
        Lists are typeset as you would do in email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        __Hyperlinks.__ Paragraph headings are surrounded by double underscores.
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL": "tutorial.do.txt". DocOnce distinguishes between paper
        and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
        generated from DocOnce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
        With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
        the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}. References to equations such as
        (ref{myeq1}) work in the same way.
        
        __Inline comments.__
        DocOnce also allows inline comments of the form [name: comment] (with
        a space after `name:`), e.g., such as [hpl: here I will make some
        remarks to the text]. Inline comments can be removed from the output
        by a command-line argument (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an
        example).
        
        __Footnotes.__ Adding a footnote[^footnote] is also possible.
        
        [^footnote]: The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.
        
        __Tables.__
        Tables are also written in the plain text way, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The DocOnce text above results in the following little document:

First a Section Heading
=======================

Section headings have 7 equality characters before and after the heading.
With 9 characters we have a chapter heading, 5 gives a subsection
heading, and 3 a subsubsection heading.

.. _my:first:sec:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and ``computer`` words look
natural in plain text.  Quotations appear inside double backticks
and double single quotes, as in "this example".

Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an ``o``
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

**Hyperlinks.**
Paragraph headings are surrounded by double underscores.
URLs with a link word are possible, as in `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in `<tutorial.do.txt>`_. DocOnce distinguishes between paper
and screen output. In traditional paper output, in PDF generated from LaTeX
generated from DocOnce, the URLs of links appear as footnotes.
With screen output, all links are clickable hyperlinks, except in
the plain text format which does not support hyperlinks.

**Cross-references.**
References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section :ref:`my:first:sec`. References to equations such as
:eq:`myeq1` work in the same way.

**Inline comments.**
DocOnce also allows inline comments such as <font color="red">[<b>hpl 1</b>: <em>here I will make
some remarks to the text</em>]</font> for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section :ref:`doconce2formats` for an example). Ordinary comment
lines start with ``#`` and are copied to comment lines in the
output format.

**Footnotes.**
Adding a footnote [#footnote]_ is also possible.

.. [#footnote] The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.

**Tables.**
Tables are also written in the plain text way, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as :math:`\nu = \sin(x)`,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in formats
not supporting LaTeX mathematics
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like :math:`\nu = \sin(x)` is
typeset as

.. code-block:: text

        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula. If you write a lot of mathematics, only the
output formats ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``, ``sphinx``, and ``pandoc``
are of interest
and all these support inline LaTeX mathematics so then you will naturally
drop the pipe symbol and write just

.. code-block:: text

        $\nu = \sin(x)$

However, if you want more textual formats, like plain text or reStructuredText,
the text after the pipe symbol may help to make the math formula more readable
if there are backslahes or other special LaTeX symbols in the LaTeX code.

Blocks of mathematics are typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
``!bt`` and ``!et`` (begin TeX, end TeX) instructions:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}
        !et

The result looks like this:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u + f, 
        

.. math::
          
        {\partial v\over\partial t} = \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics
(this includes ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``ipynb``, ``pandoc``,
and ``mwiki``). Simpler
formats have to just list the raw
LaTeX syntax.

LaTeX writers who adopt DocOnce need to pay attention to the following:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the ``html``, ``sphinx``,
   and ``ipynb`` formats.

 * Only five equation environments can be used: ``\[ ... \]``,
   ``equation*``, ``equation``, ``align*``, and ``align``.

 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   ``newcommands*.tex``.

 * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. admonition:: Remark

   Although DocOnce allows user-defined styles in the preamble of LaTeX output,
   HTML-based output cannot make use of such styles. If-else constructs for
   the preprocessor can be used to allow special LaTeX environments for
   LaTeX output and alternative typesetting for other formats, but it is
   recommended to stay away from special environments in the text and
   write in a simpler fashion. For example, DocOnce has no special construction
   for algorithms, so these must be simulated by lists or verbatim blocks.
   Other constructions that should be avoided include margin notes, special
   tables, and
   ``subfigure`` (combine image files to one file instead, via ``doconce combine_images``).




You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` instructions, respectively.

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pycod
        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
        !ec

Such blocks are formatted as

.. code-block:: python

        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to ``sphinx``, ``rst``, and formats close to plain text),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!).

Another document can be included by writing ``# #include "mynote.do.txt"``
at the beginning of a line.  DocOnce documents have
extension ``do.txt``. The ``do`` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing ``.txt`` denotes a text document so that editors gives you
plain text editing capabilities.

.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

DocOnce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands are defined in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``, using standard LaTeX syntax. Only newcommands
for use inside math environments are supported.

Labels, corss-references, citations, and support of an index and
bibliography are much inspired by LaTeX syntax, but DocOnce features
no backslashes. Use labels for sections and equations only, and
preceed the reference by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of
an equation, surround the reference by parenthesis.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: text

        ===== My Section =====
        label{sec:mysec}
        
        idx{key equation} idx{$\u$ conservation}
        
        We refer to Section ref{sec:yoursec} for background material on
        the *key equation*. Here we focus on the extension
        
        # \Ddt, \u and \mycommand are defined in newcommands_keep.tex
        
        !bt
        \begin{equation}
        \Ddt{\u} = \mycommand{v},
        label{mysec:eq:Dudt}
        \end{equation}
        !et
        where $\Ddt{\u}$ is the material derivative of $\u$.
        Equation (ref{mysec:eq:Dudt}) is important in a number
        of contexts, see cite{Larsen_et_al_2002,Johnson_Friedman_2010a}.
        Also, cite{Miller_2000} supports such a view.
        
        As see in Figure ref{mysec:fig:myfig}, the key equation
        features large, smooth regions *and* abrupt changes.
        
        FIGURE: [fig/myfile, width=600 frac=0.9] My figure. label{mysec:fig:myfig}
        
        ===== References =====
        
        BIBFILE: papers.pub

For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the ``doc/manual/manual.do.txt`` file
in the DocOnce source and a `Sphinx version <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/>`_ of this document.

.. _doconce2formats:

From DocOnce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a DocOnce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats is done with the script ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format formatname mydoc.do.txt

or just drop the extension:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format formatname mydoc

Generating a makefile
---------------------

Producing HTML, Sphinx, and in particular LaTeX documents from
DocOnce sources requires a few commands. Often you want to
produce several different formats. The relevant commands should
then be placed in a script that acts as a "makefile".

The ``doconce makefile`` can be used to automatically generate
such a makefile, more precisely a Python script ``make.py``, which
carries out the commands explained below. If our DocOnce source
is in ``main_myproj.do.txt``, we run

.. code-block:: text

        doconce makefile main_myproj html pdflatex sphinx

to produce the necessary output for generating HTML, pdfLaTeX, and
Sphinx. Usually, you need to edit ``make.py`` to really fit your
needs. Some examples lines are inserted as comments to show
various options that can be added to the basic commands.
A handy feature of the generated ``make.py`` script is that it
inserts checks for successful runs of the many ``doconce`` commands,
and if something goes wrong, the script aborts.

Preprocessing
-------------

The ``preprocess`` and ``mako`` programs are used to preprocess the
file. The DocOnce program detects whether ``preprocess`` and/or ``mako``
statements are present and runs the corresponding programs, first
``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.

Variables to ``preprocess`` and/or ``mako`` can be added after the
filename with the syntax ``-DMYVAR``, ``-DMYVAR=val`` or ``MYVAR=val``.

 * The form ``-DMYVAR`` defines the variable ``MYVAR`` for ``preprocess`` (like the
   same syntax for the C preprocessor - ``MYVAR`` is defined, but has
   not specific value). When running ``mako``, ``-DMYVAR`` means that
   ``MYVAR`` has the (Python) value ``True``.

 * The expressions ``-DMYVAR=val`` and ``MYVAR=val`` are
   equivalent. When running ``preprocess``, ``MYVAR`` is defined and has
   the value ``val`` (``# #ifdef MYVAR`` and ``# #if MYVAR == "val"`` are both
   true tests), while for ``mako``, ``MYVAR`` exists as
   variable and has the value ``val`` (``% if MYVAR == "val"`` is true).

Note that ``MYVAR=False`` defines ``MYVAR`` in ``preprocess`` and
any test ``# #ifdef MYVAR`` is always true, regardless of the value one has
set ``MYVAR`` to, so a better test is
``# #if MYVAR == True``. In general, it is recommended to go with
``preprocess`` directives if the tests are very simple, as in
``# #ifdef MYVAR`` or ``# #if FORMAT == "latex"``, otherwise use
only ``mako`` syntax like ``% if MYVAR or YOURVAR:`` to incorporate
``if`` tests in the preprocessor phases.

Two examples on defining preprocessor variables are

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5
        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess`` or ``mako``. That is, in the above examples, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``sphinx``. Inside the DocOnce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "sphinx"``
(for ``preprocess``) or ``% if FORMAT == "sphinx":`` (for ``mako``).

The result of running ``preprocess`` on a DocOnce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is available in a file ``tmp_preprocess__mydoc.do.txt``. Similarly,
the result of running ``mako`` is available in
``tmp_mako__mydoc.do.txt``. By examining these files one can see exactly
what the preprocessors have done.

Removal of inline comments
--------------------------

The command-line arguments ``--no_preprocess`` and ``--no_mako`` turn off
running ``preprocess`` and ``mako``, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original DocOnce
file by running:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a DocOnce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

Notes
-----

DocOnce does not have a tag for longer notes, because implementation
of a "notes feature" is so easy using the ``preprocess`` or ``mako``
programs. Just introduce some variable, say ``NOTES``, that you define
through ``-DNOTES`` (or not) when running ``doconce format ...``. Inside
the document you place your notes between ``# #ifdef NOTES`` and
``# #endif`` preprocess tags. Alternatively you use ``% if NOTES:``
and ``% endif`` that ``mako`` will recognize. In the same way you may
encapsulate unfinished material, extra material to be removed
for readers but still nice to archive as part of the document for
future revisions.

Demo of different formats
-------------------------

A simple scientific report is available in `a lot of different formats <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/doconce_commands.html>`_.
How to create the different formats is explained in more depth
in the coming sections.

HTML
----

Basics
~~~~~~

Making an HTML version of a DocOnce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

Typesetting of Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Pygments package (including the ``pygmentize`` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument ``--no_pygments_html``
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain (``pre``) HTML tags. The option ``--pygments_html_linenos`` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks. A specific
Pygments style is set by ``--pygments_html_style=style``, where ``style``
can be ``default``, ``emacs``, ``perldoc``, and other valid names for
Pygments styles.

Handling of Movies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MP4, WebM, and Ogg movies are typeset with the HTML5 ``video`` tag
and the HTML code tries to load as many versions among MP4, WebM,
and Ogg as exist (and the files are loaded in the mentioned order).
If just the specified file is to be loaded, use the
``--no_mp4_webm_ogg_alternatives`` command-line option.
Other movie formats, e.g., ``.flv``, ``.mpeg`` and ``.avi``, are embedded via
the older ``embed`` tag.

HTML Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML style can be defined either in the header of the HTML file,
using a named built-in style;
in an external CSS file; or in a template file.

An external CSS file ``filename`` used by setting the command-line
argument ``--css=filename``. There available built-in styles are
specified as ``--html_style=name``, where ``name`` can be

 * ``solarized``: the famous `solarized <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>`_
   style (yellowish),

 * ``blueish``: a simple style with blue headings (default),

 * ``blueish2``: a variant of *bluish*,

 * ``bloodish``: as ``bluish``, but dark read as color.

Using ``--css=filename`` where ``filename`` is a non-existing file makes
DocOnce write the built-in style to that file. Otherwise the HTML
links to the CSS stylesheet in ``filename``. Several stylesheets can
be specified: ``--ccs=file1.css,file2.css,file3.css``.

HTML templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Templates are HTML files with "slots" ``%(main)s`` for the main body
of text, ``%(title)s`` for the title, and ``%(date)s`` for the date.
DocOnce comes with a few templates. The usage of templates is
described in a "separate document": "". That document describes how you your DocOnce-generated
HTML file can have any specified layout.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template with your own tailored
design, see a `tutorial <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tech_wrapper.htl>`_ on this topic. The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": ``%(title)s`` for a title,
``%(date)s`` for a date, and ``%(main)s`` for the main body of text. The
latter is the
DocOnce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the DocOnce document, or the title (but a title is not
recommended when using templates). The date is extracted from the
``DATE:`` line. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. DocOnce comes with
two templates in ``bundled/html_styles``. Just copy the directory
containing the template and the CSS and JavaScript files to your
document directory, edit the template as needed (also check that
paths to the ``css`` and ``js`` subdirectories are correct - according
to how you store the template files), and run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_template=mytemplate.html

The template in ``style_vagrant`` also needs an extra option
``--html_style=vagrant``. With this style, one has nice navigation buttons
that are used if the document contains ``!split`` commands for splitting
it into many pages.

The HTML File Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are usually a range of files needed for an HTML document arising
from a DocOnce source. The needed files are listed in
``.basename_html_file_collection``, where ``basename`` is the filestem of
the DocOnce file (i.e., the DocOnce source is in ``basename.do.txt``).

Filenames
~~~~~~~~~

An HTML version of a DocOnce document is often made in different styles,
calling for a need to rename the HTML output file. This is conveniently
done by the ``--html_output=basename`` option, where ``basename`` is the
filestem of the associated HTML files. The
``.basename_html_file_collection`` file lists all the needed files
for the HTML document. Here is an example on making three versions of
the HTML document: ``mydoc_bloodish.html``, ``mydoc_solarized``, and
``mydoc_vagrant``.

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=bloodish \ 
                  --html_output=mydoc_bloodish
        Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc_bloodish.html
        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=solarized \ 
                  --html_output=mydoc_solarized \ 
                  --pygments_html_style=perldoc --html_admon=apricot
        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=vagrant \ 
                  --html_output=mydoc_vagrant --pygments_html_style=default \ 
                  --html_template=templates/my_adapted_vagrant_template.html
        Terminal> doconce split_html mydoc_vagrant.html

Blog Posts
----------

DocOnce can be used for writing blog posts provided the blog site accepts
raw HTML code. Google's Blogger service (``blogger.com`` or
``blogname.blogspot.com``) is particularly well suited since it also
allows extensive LaTeX mathematics via MathJax.

1. Write the text of the blog post as a DocOnce document without any
   title, author, and date.

2. Generate HTML as described above.

3. Copy the text and paste it into the
   text area in the blog post (just delete the HTML code that initially
   pops up in the text area). Make sure the input format is HTML.

See a `simple blog example <http://doconce.blogspot.no>`_ and
a `scientific report <http://doconce-report-demo.blogspot.no/>`_
for demonstrations of blog posts at ``blogspot.no``.


.. warning::
    The comment field after the blog post does not recognize MathJax (LaTeX)
    mathematics or code with indentation. However, using a MathJax
    bookmarklet, e.g., at `<http://checkmyworking.com/misc/mathjax-bookmarklet/>`_, one can get the mathematics properly rendered. The comment fields are
    not suitable for computer code, though, as HTML tags are not allowed.





.. note::
   Figure files must be uploaded to some web site and the local filenames name must
   be replaced by the relevant URL. This is usually done by using the
   ``--figure_prefix=http://project.github.io/...`` option to give some URL
   as prefix to all figure names (a similar ``--movie_prefix=`` option exists as
   well).
   
   Changing figure names in a blog post can also be done "manually" by
   some editing code in the script that compiles the DocOnce document
   to HTML format:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
           cp mydoc.do.txt mydoc2.do.txt
           url="https//raw.github.com/someuser/someuser.github.com"
           dir="master/project/dir1/dir2"
           for figname in fig1 fig2 fig3; do
             doconce replace "[$figname," "[$site/$dir/$figname.png," \ 
                     mydoc2.do.txt
           done
           doconce format html mydoc2
           # Paste mydoc2.html into a new blog post page




.. See here if MathJax stops working in HTML pages on blogger and elsewhere:

.. `<http://weiqigao.blogspot.no/2013/03/enabling-mathjax-in-blogger.html>`_

Blog posts at Google can also be published `automatically through email <http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41452>`_.
A Python program can send the contents of the HTML file
to the blog site's email address using the packages  ``smtplib`` and ``email``.

WordPress (``wordpress.com``) allows raw HTML code in blogs,
but has very limited
LaTeX support, basically only formulas. The ``--wordpress`` option to
``doconce`` modifies the HTML code such that all equations are typeset
in a way that is acceptable to WordPress.
Look at a `simple doconce example <http://doconce.wordpress.com>`_
and a `scientific report <http://doconcereportdemo.wordpress.com/>`_
to see blog posts with mathematics and code on WordPress.

Speaking of WordPress, the related project `<http://pressbooks.com>`_ can take raw HTML code (from DocOnce, for
instance) and produce very nice-looking books.  There is no support
for mathematics in the text, though.

Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is ``mydoc.md``.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.md

Pandoc supports ``latex``, ``html``, ``odt`` (OpenOffice), ``docx`` (Microsoft
Word), ``rtf``, ``texinfo``, to mention some. The ``-R`` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the ``--toc`` option generates a table of contents.
See the `Pandoc documentation <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>`_
for the many features of the ``pandoc`` program.

Markdown to HTML conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML output from
``pandoc`` needs adjustments to provide full support for MathJax LaTeX
mathematics, and for this purpose one should use ``doconce md2html``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> doconce m2html mydoc

The result ``mydoc.html`` can be viewed in a browser.

Using Pandoc to go from LaTeX to MS Word or HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS
Word.  There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your
document): ``doconce format pandoc`` and then translating using ``doconce
md2latex`` (which runs ``pandoc``), or ``doconce format latex``, and then
going from LaTeX to the desired format using ``pandoc``.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce replace '\Verb!' '\verb!' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through ``pandoc``, only single equations, ``align``, or ``align*``
environments are well understood for output to HTML.

Note that DocOnce applies the ``Verb`` macro from the ``fancyvrb`` package
while ``pandoc`` only supports the standard ``verb`` construction for
inline verbatim text.  Moreover, quite some additional ``doconce
replace`` and ``doconce subst`` edits might be needed on the ``.mkd`` or
``.tex`` files to successfully have mathematics that is well translated
to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using Pandoc, it can
be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Strict Markdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option ``--strict_markdown_output`` generates plain or strict
Markdown without the many extension that Pandoc accepts in Markdown
syntax.

GitHub-flavored Markdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding the command-line option ``github-md`` turns on the GutHub-flavored
Markdown dialect, which is used for the issue tracker on `GitHub <http://github.com>`_. A special feature is the support of task lists:
unnumbered lists with ``[x]`` (task done) or ``[ ]`` (task not done).
(Tables get typeset directly as HTML and the syntax for code highlighting
is different from Pandoc extended Markdown.) Below is a typical
response in a GitHub issue tracker
where one first quotes the issue and then provides an answer:

.. code-block:: text

        !bquote
        ===== Problems with a function =====
        
        There is a problem with the `f(x)` function
        
        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return 1 + x
        !ec
        This function should be quadratic.
        !equote
        
        OK, this is fixed:
        
        !bc pycod
        def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
            return a*x**2 + b*x + c
        !ec
        
        ===== Updated task list =====
        
           * [x] Offer an `f(x)` function
           * [ ] Extension to cubic functions
           * [x] Allowing general coefficient in the quadratic function
        
        === Remaining functionality ===
        
        |---------------------------------------------------------------|
        | function | purpose                        | state |
        |----l-----------l------------------------------l---------------|
        |  `g(x)`  | Compute the Gaussian function. | Formula ready. |
        |  `h(x)`  | Heaviside function.            | Formula ready. |
        |  `I(x)`  | Indicator function.            | Nothing done yet. |
        |---------------------------------------------------------------|

Say this text is stored in a file ``mycomments.do.txt``. Running

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mycomments --github_md

produces the Markdown file ``mycomments.md``, which can be pasted into
the Write field of
the GitHub issue tracker. Turning on Preview shows the typesetting of
the quote, compute code, inline verbatim, headings, the task list, and
the table.

MultiMarkdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option ``--multimarkdown_output`` generates the MultiMarkdown
version of Markdown (as opposed to Pandoc-extended Markdown (default),
strict Markdown, or GitHub-flavored Markdown).

Strapdown rendering of Markdown text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Strapdown <http://strapdownjs.com>`_ is a tool that can render Markdown
text nicely in a web browser by just inserting an HTML header and
footer in the Markdown file and load the file into a browser.
The option ``--strapdown`` outputs the relevant header and footer.
The output file must be renamed such that it gets the extension ``.html``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc --strict_markdown_output \ 
                  --strapdown --bootstrap_bootwatch_theme=slate
        Terminal> mv mydoc.md mydoc.html

The ``--bootstrap_bootwatch_theme=theme`` option is used to choose
a `Bootswatch <http://bootswatch.com/>`_ theme whose names are
found on the `Strapdown page <http://strapdownjs.com>`_.

LaTeX
-----


.. note::
   XeLaTeX and pdfLaTeX are used very much in the same way as standard
   LaTeX. The minor differences are described in separate sections
   of the documentation of the DocOnce to LaTeX translation.




Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
1) compile the DocOnce source to the ``ptex2tex`` format, and 2) compile
the ``ptex2tex`` format to standard LaTeX.
The `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_ format can be
viewed as an extended LaTeX. For DocOnce users, the ``ptex2tex`` format
essentially means that the file consists of

1. ``if-else`` statements for the ``preprocess`` processor such that
   LaTeX constructions can be activated or deactivated, and

2. all code environments can be typeset according to a ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
   configuration file.

Point 2 is only of interest if you aim to use a special computer code
formatting that requires you to use a configuration file and
the ``ptex2tex`` program.

The reason for generating ``ptex2tex`` and not standard LaTeX directly
from DocOnce was that the ``ptex2tex`` format shows a range of possible
LaTeX constructions for controlling the layout. It can be instructive
for LaTeX users to look at this code before choosing specific parts
for some desired layout. Experts may also want to edit this code
(which should be automated by a script such that the edits can be
repeated when the DocOnce source is modified, see Step 2b below).
(Direct control of the LaTeX layout in the ``doconce format`` program
would not spit out alternative LaTeX constructs as is now done through
the ``ptex2tex`` step.)

Going from ``ptex2tex`` format to standard LaTeX format is enabled by
either the ``ptex2tex`` program or DocOnce's (simplified) version of it:
``doconce ptex2tex``. Details are given below.


.. admonition:: Information on typesetting of inline verbatim

   The ``ptex2tex`` and the ``doconce ptex2tex`` programs take inline verbatim
   code, typeset with backticks in DocOnce, and translate this to
   
   .. code-block:: text
   
           \Verb!text!
   
   Thereafter, if ``text`` does not contain illegal characters for the ``\texttt``
   command, the latter is used instead since then LaTeX can insert
   linebreaks in the inline verbatim text and hence avoid overfull hboxes.




.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.

**Step 1.**
Filter the doconce text to the ``ptex2tex`` "pre-LaTeX form"
``mydoc.p.tex``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section :ref:`newcommands`).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

An option ``--device=paper`` makes some adjustments for documents
aimed at being printed. For example, links to web resources are
associated with a footnote listing the complete web address (URL).
(Very long URLs in footnotes can be shortened using services such
as `<http://goo.gl/>`_, `<http://tinyurl.com/>`_, and
`<https://bitly.com/>`_.)
The default, ``--device=screen``, creates a PDF file for reading
on a screen where links are just clickable.

There are many additional options (run ``doconce format --help`` and
look for options starting with ``--latex`` to get a more verbose description):

 * ``--latex_font=helvetica,palatino``

 * ``--latex_papersize=a4,a6``

 * ``--latex_bibstyle=plain``

 * ``--latex_title_layout=titlepage,std,beamer,doconce_heading``

 * ``--latex_style=std,Springer_lncse,Springer_llncs,Springer_T2,...``

 * ``--latex_list_of_exercises=loe,toc,none``

 * ``--latex_fancy_header``

 * ``--latex_section_headings=std,blue,strongblue,gray,gray-wide``

 * ``--latex_colored_table_rows=blue,gray,no``

 * ``--latex_todonotes``

 * ``--latex_double_spacing``

 * ``--latex_preamble=filename``

 * ``--latex_admon=mdfbox,graybox2,grayicon,yellowicon,paragraph,colors1,colors2``

 * ``--latex_admon_color=0.34,0.02,0.8``

 * ``--latex_admon_envir_map=2``

 * ``--latex_exercise_numbering=absolute,chapter``

 * ``--latex_movie=media9,href,multimedia,movie15``

 * ``--latex_movie_controls=on``

 * ``--latex_external_movie_viewer`` (for ``movie15`` package)

 * ``--xelatex``

**Step 2.**
Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have installed the
Python ptex2tex package) to make a standard LaTeX file,

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ``ptex2tex``, you may run the (simplified) version
that comes with DocOnce:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc

The ``ptex2tex`` command can set two preprocessor variables:

 * ``PREAMBLE`` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere - and note that
   the preamble is only included
   if the document has a title, author, and date)

 * ``MINTED`` for inclusion of the minted package for typesetting of
   code with the Pygments tool (which requires ``latex``
   or ``pdflatex`` to be run with the ``-shell-escape`` option); not used
   for ``doconce ptex2tex`` only in the ``ptex2tex`` program

If you are not satisfied with the generated DocOnce preamble, you can provide
your own preamble by adding the command-line option ``--latex_preamble=myfile``.
In case ``myfile`` contains a documentclass definition, DocOnce assumes
that the file contains the *complete* preamble you want (not that all
the packages listed in the default preamble are required and must be
present in ``myfile``). Otherwise, ``myfile`` is assumed to contain
*additional* LaTeX code to be added to the DocOnce default preamble.

The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer code in LaTeX documents. After
any ``!bc`` command in the DocOnce source you can insert verbatim block
styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file, e.g., ``!bc sys`` for a
terminal session, where ``sys`` is set to a certain environment in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeTerminal``).  There are about 40 styles to
choose from, and you can easily add new ones.

The ``doconce ptex2tex`` allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc \ 
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \ 
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that ``@`` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as ``minted``
above, which implies ``\begin{minted}{fortran}`` and ``\end{minted}`` as
begin and end for blocks inside ``!bc fpro`` and ``!ec``).  Specifying
``envir=ans:nt`` means that all other environments are typeset with the
``anslistings.sty`` package, e.g., ``!bc cppcod`` will then result in
``\begin{c++}``. A predefined shortcut as in ``shcod=Verbatim-0.85``
results in denser
vertical spacing (baselinestretch 0.85 in LaTeX terminology), and
``shcod=Verbatim-indent`` implies indentation of the verbatim text.
Alternatively, one can provide all desired parameters
``\begin{Verbatim}`` instruction using the syntax illustrated for
the ``sys`` environments above.

If no environments like ``sys``, ``fpro``, or the common
``envir`` are defined on the command line, the plain ``\begin{Verbatim}``
and ``\end{Verbatim}`` instructions are used.

**Step 2b (optional).**
Edit the ``mydoc.tex`` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute ``section`` by ``section*`` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst``
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
You will use ``doconce replace`` to edit ``section{`` to ``section*{``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex

For fixing the line break of a title, you may pick a word in the
title, say "Using", and insert a break after than word. With
``doconce subst`` this is easy employing regular expressions with
a group before "Using" and a group after:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \ 
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file so the ``doconce subst`` or
``doconce replace`` commands can be put inside the script.

**Step 3.**
Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

See the next two sections for compilation with XeLaTeX or pdfLaTeX.

If one wishes to use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., in
``ptex2tex`` specified through the ``*pro`` and ``*cod`` variables in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` or ``$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg``), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is automatically included by ``doconce ptex2tex`` if
the minted style is used, while you have to include the
``-DMINTED`` preprocessor option when running the ``ptex2tex`` program:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

If the minted style is used, ``latex`` (or ``pdflatex`` or ``xelatex``)
*must* be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

PDFLaTeX
--------

Running ``pdflatex`` instead of ``latex`` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ``ptex2tex`` is run as explained above, and finally

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc

XeLaTeX
-------

XeLaTeX is an alternative to pdfLaTeX and is run in almost the
same way, except for the ``--xelatex`` flag to ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pdflatex mydoc --xelatex
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> xelatex mydoc

From PDF to e-book formats
--------------------------

PDF (as generated from LaTeX above) can be read on most devices today.
However, for Kindle and other devices specialized for e-books you
need to convert to their format. The `Calibre <http://calibre-ebook.com/>`_
program can produce epub, mobi, and other e-book formats from PDF,
see a `description <http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/latex-lyx-e-books.html>`_.

Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from DocOnce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt

reStructuredText
----------------

Going from DocOnce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the DocOnce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program ``unovonv``
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
``mydoc.odt`` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt

**Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.**
At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from DocOnce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by ``latex`` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the ``sphinx`` output format.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \ 
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \ 
                  theme=mytheme mydoc

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

One often just runs the simple command

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

which creates the Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake_sphinx.py`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  Run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python automake_sphinx.py

As the output also tells, you can see the Sphinx HTML version of the document
by running

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> google-chrome sphinx-rootdir/_build/html/index.html

or loading the ``index.html`` file manually into your favorite web browser.

If you cycle through editing the DocOnce file and watching the
HTML output, you should observe that ``automake_sphinx.py`` does not
recompile the DocOnce file if the Sphinx ``.rst`` version already exists.
In each edit-and-watch cycle do

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> rm mydoc.rst; python automake_sphinx.py


.. admonition:: Tip

   If you are new
   to Sphinx and end up producing quite some Sphinx documents, you are encouraged
   to read the Sphinx documentation and study the ``automake_sphinx.py``
   file. Maybe you want to do things differently.




The following paragraphs describes the many possibilities for steering
the Sphinx output.

**Links.**
The ``automake_sphinx.py`` script copies directories named ``fig*``
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  It also examines ``MOVIE:`` and ``FIGURE:``
commands in the DocOnce file to find other image files and copies
these too. I strongly recommend to put files
to which there are local links (not ``http:`` or ``file:`` URLs) in
a directory named ``_static``. The ``automake_sphinx.py`` copies
``_static*`` to the Sphinx directory, which guarantees that the links
to the local files will work in the Sphinx document.

There is a utility ``doconce sphinxfix_localURLs`` for checking links to
local files and moving the files to ``_static`` and changing the links
accordingly. For example, a link to ``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` is changed
to ``_static/myfile.txt`` and ``myfile.txt`` is copied to ``_static``.
However, I recommend instead that you manually copy
files to ``_static`` when you want to link to them, or let your
script which compiles the DocOnce document do it automatically.

**Themes.**
DocOnce comes with a rich collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents,
much larger than what is found in the standard Sphinx distribution.
Additional themes include
``agni``,
``basicstrap``,
``bootstrap``,
``cloud``,
``fenics``,
``fenics_minimal``,
``flask``,
``haiku``,
``impressjs``,
``jal``,
``pylons``,
``redcloud``,
``scipy_lectures``,
``slim-agogo``, and
``vlinux-theme``.

All the themes are packed out in the Sphinx directory, and the
``doconce sphinx_dir`` insert lots of extra code in the ``conf.py``
file to enable easy specification and customization of themes.
For example, modules are loaded for the additional themes that
come with DocOnce, code is inserted to allow customization of
the look and feel of themes, etc. The ``conf.py`` file is a
good starting point for fine-tuning your favorite team, and your
own ``conf.py`` file can later be supplied and used when running
``doconce sphinx_dir``: simply add the command-line option
``conf.py=conf.py``.

A script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics``, ``pyramid``, and ``pylon`` one writes

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid pylon

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!). With ``make-themes.sh``
it is easy to check out various themes to find the one that is most
attractive for your document.

You may supply your own theme and avoid copying all the themes
that come with DocOnce into the Sphinx directory. Just specify
``theme_dir=path`` on the command line, where ``path`` is the relative
path to the directory containing the Sphinx theme. You must also
specify a configure file by ``conf.py=path``, where ``path`` is the
relative path to your ``conf.py`` file.

**Example.**
Say you like the ``scipy_lectures`` theme, but you want
a table of contents to appear *to the right*, much in the same style
as in the ``default`` theme (where the table of contents is to the left).
You can then run ``doconce sphinx_dir``, invoke a text editor with the
``conf.py`` file, find the line ``html_theme == 'scipy_lectures'``,
edit the following ``nosidebar`` to ``false`` and ``rightsidebar`` to ``true``.
Alternatively, you may write a little script using ``doconce replace``
to replace a portion of text in ``conf.py`` by a new one:

.. code-block:: bash

        doconce replace "elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
            html_theme_options = {
                'nosidebar': 'true',
                'rightsidebar': 'false',
                'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
                'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
                'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
                'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
                'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
            }" "elif html_theme == 'scipy_lectures':
            html_theme_options = {
                'nosidebar': 'false',
                'rightsidebar': 'true',
                'sidebarbgcolor': '#f2f2f2',
                'sidebartextcolor': '#20435c',
                'sidebarlinkcolor': '#20435c',
                'footerbgcolor': '#000000',
                'relbarbgcolor': '#000000',
            }" conf.py

Obviously, we could also have changed colors in the edit above.
The final alternative is to save the edited ``conf.py`` file somewhere
and reuse it the next time ``doconce sphinx_dir`` is run

.. code-block:: text

        doconce sphinx_dir theme=scipy_lectures \ 
                           conf.py=../some/path/conf.py mydoc

The manual Sphinx procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

**Step 1.**
Translate DocOnce into the Sphinx format:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc

**Step 2.**
Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

.. code-block:: text

        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated ``conf.py`` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` generator makes an extended ``conv.py``
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.

**Step 3.**
Copy the ``mydoc.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.
Links to local files in ``mydoc.rst`` must be modified to links to
files in the ``_static`` directory, see comment above.

**Step 4.**
Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes

.. code-block:: text

        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

**Step 5.**
Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

.. code-block:: text

        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with ``index.html`` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

**Step 6.**
View the result:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but DocOnce only supports three:
`Googlecode wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_,
`MediaWiki <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting>`_, and
`Creole Wiki <http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0>`_.
These formats are called
``gwiki``, ``mwiki``, and ``cwiki``, respectively.
Transformation from DocOnce to these formats is done by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt

The produced MediaWiki can be tested in the `sandbox of
wikibooks.org <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sandbox>`_. The format
works well with Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and
`ShoutWiki <http://doconcedemo.shoutwiki.com/wiki/DocOnce_demo_page>`_,
but not always well elsewhere
(see `this example <http://doconcedemo.jumpwiki.com/wiki/First_demo>`_).

Large MediaWiki documents can be made with the
`Book creator <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator>`_.
From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of `mwlib <http://pediapress.com/code/>`_. This means that one can
easily use DocOnce to write `Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org>`_
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format, while
at the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book, a Sphinx web document, or a collection of HTML files.

The Googlecode wiki document, ``mydoc.gwiki``, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the DocOnce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the ``.gwiki`` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

Google Docs
-----------

Google Docs are normally made online in the interactive editor. However,
you may upload a DocOnce document to Google Docs. This requires transforming
the DocOnce document to one of the accepted formats for Google Docs:

 * OpenOffice: ``doconce format rst`` and then run
   ``rst2odt`` (or ``rst2odt.py``). Upload the ``.odt`` file, click
   *Open...* in Google Drive and choose *Google Docs* as viewer.

 * MS Word: ``doconce format pandoc`` and then run ``pandoc`` to
   produce a ``.docx`` file that can be uploaded to Google Drive
   and opened in Google Docs.

 * RTF: ``doconce format pandoc`` and then run ``pandoc`` to produce
   a ``.rtf`` file that can be uploaded to Google Drive and opened.
   Another possibility is to run ``doconce format latex`` and
   then `latex2rtf <http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf>`_
   (the support of mathematics has gotten worse).

 * Plain text: ``doconce format plain``. Upload the ``.txt`` file
   to Google Drive and open in Google Docs.

 * HTML: ``doconce format html``. Upload the ``.html`` file and
   open in Google Docs. Complicated HTML files can be misinterpreted
   by Google Docs.

This is not yet much tested. It remains to see how code becomes in
Google Docs. Support for mathematics is probably impossible until
Google Docs can import LaTeX files, but LaTeX mathematics can be embedded
in Google Docs and the `googledoc2latex <http://code.google.com/p/googledoc2latex>`_ script can convert a Google document to LaTeX.

Tweaking the DocOnce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from DocOnce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
DocOnce to reStructuredText. Since DocOnce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from DocOnce. It is then wise to run DocOnce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from DocOnce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a DocOnce format stored in the file

.. code-block:: text

        doc/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file ``make.sh`` in the ``tutorial`` directory of the
DocOnce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, ``tutorial.do.txt`` is the
starting point.  Running ``make.sh`` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original ``tutorial.do.txt`` file,
gives a quick introduction to how DocOnce is used in a real case.

There is another demo in the ``docs/manual`` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, ``manual.do.txt``, to
various formats. The ``make.sh`` script runs a set of translations.

.. _install:doconce:

Installation of DocOnce and its Dependencies
============================================

Below, we explain the manual installation of all software that may be
needed when working with DocOnce documents.
The impatient way to install what is needed is to run the
`install_doconce.sh <install_doconce.sh>`_ (or
`install_doconce.py <install_doconce.py>`_) script.

DocOnce
-------

DocOnce itself is pure Python code hosted at `<https://github.com/hplgit/doconce>`_.
Installation can be done via

.. code-block:: text

        sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/hplgit/doconce#egg=doconce
        # or if doconce is already installed
        sudo pip install -e git+https://github.com/hplgit/doconce#egg=doconce --upgrade

Alternatively, one can run the standard procedure

.. code-block:: text

        git clone git@github.com:hplgit/doconce.git
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since DocOnce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:

.. code-block:: text

        cd doconce
        git pull origin master
        sudo python setup.py install

Dependencies
------------

Producing HTML documents, plain text, pandoc-extended Markdown,
and wikis can be done without installing any other
software. However, if you want other formats as output
(LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText) and assisting utilities such
as preprocesors, spellcheck, file differences, bibliographies,
and so on, the software below must be installed.

To install all needed packages on a GNU/Linux Debian system, such as
Ubuntu, you can jump to the script in the section :ref:`install:debian:script`.

.. Make a debpkg_doconce.txt file with everything that is needed on Debian

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

.. code-block:: text

        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_. Its installation is most
conveniently done by ``pip``,

.. code-block:: text

        pip install Mako

This command requires ``pip`` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the ``pip`` `source code <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

Mako can also be installed directly from
`source <http://www.makotemplates.org/download.html>`_: download the
tarball, pack it out, go to the directory and run
the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.

Image file handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different output formats require different formats of image files.
For example, PostScript or Encapuslated PostScript is required for
``latex`` output, while HTML needs JPEG, GIF, or PNG formats.  DocOnce
calls up programs from the ImageMagick suite for converting image
files to a proper format if needed. The `ImageMagick suite <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>`_ can be installed on all
major platforms.  On Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems one can
simply write

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install imagemagick

The convenience program ``doconce combine_images``, for combining several
images into one, will use ``montage`` and ``convert`` from ImageMagick and
the ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``pdfcrop`` programs from the ``texlive-extra-utils``
Debian package. The latter gets installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install texlive-extra-utils

Automatic image conversion from EPS to PDF calls up ``epstopdf``, which
can be installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install texlive-font-utils

Spellcheck
~~~~~~~~~~

The utility ``doconce spellcheck`` applies the ``ispell`` program for
spellcheck. On Debian (including Ubuntu) it is installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install ispell

Bibliography
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python package `Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`_ is needed if you use a bibliography
in your document. On the website, click on *Clone*, copy the
command and run it:

.. code-block:: text

        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish

Thereafter go to the ``publish`` directory and run the ``setup.py`` script
for installing Publish:

.. code-block:: text

        cd publish
        sudo python setup.py

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_,
which is installed by

.. code-block:: text

        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, ``cp2texmf.sh``:

.. code-block:: text

        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install texlive

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/misc`` directory).

Note that the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command, which needs no installation
beyond DocOnce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ``ptex2tex``
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ``ptex2tex`` and ``doconce ptext2tex``
and popular among many
users. This style requires the package `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_
to be installed. On Debian Linux,

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install python-pygments

Alternatively, the package can be installed manually:

.. code-block:: text

        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install

One can also do the simple

.. code-block:: text

        pip install sphinx

which also installs pygments.

If you use the minted style together with ``ptex2tex``, you have to
enable it by the ``-DMINTED`` command-line argument to ``ptex2tex``.
This is not necessary if you run the alternative ``doconce ptex2tex`` program.

All use of the minted style requires the ``-shell-escape`` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., ``latex -shell-escape`` or ``pdflatex
-shell-escape``.

Inline comments apply the ``todonotes`` LaTeX package if the option
``--latex_todonotes`` is given.  The ``todonotes`` package requires
several other packages: ``xcolor``, ``ifthen``, ``xkeyval``, ``tikz``, ``calc``,
``graphicx``, and ``setspace``. The relevant Debian packages for
installing all this are listed below.

LaTeX packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many LaTeX packages are potentially needed (depending on various
preprocessor variables given to ``ptex2tex`` or ``doconce ptex2tex``.  The
standard packages always included are ``relsize``, ``epsfig``, ``makeidx``,
``setspace``, ``color``, ``amsmath``, ``amsfonts``, ``xcolor``, ``bm``,
``microtype``, ``titlesec``, and ``hyperref``.  The ``ptex2tex`` package (from
`ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_) is also included, but
removed again if ``doconce ptex2tex`` is run instead of the ``ptex2tex``
program, meaning that if you do not use ``ptex2tex``, you do not need
``ptex2tex.sty``. Optional packages that might be included are ``minted``,
``fontspec``, ``xunicode``, ``inputenc``, ``helvet``, ``mathpazo``, ``wrapfig``,
``calc``, ``ifthen``, ``xkeyval``, ``tikz``, ``graphicx``, ``setspace``, ``shadow``,
``disable``, ``todonotes``, ``lineno``, ``xr``, ``framed``, ``mdframe``,
``movie15``, ``a4paper``, and ``a6paper``.

Relevant Debian packages that gives you all of these LaTeX packages are

.. code-block:: text

        texlive
        texlive-extra-utils
        texlive-latex-extra
        texlive-font-utils

On old Ubuntu 12.04 one has to do ``sudo add-apt-repository ppa:texlive-backports/ppa`` and ``sudo apt-get update`` first, or alternatively install these as well:

.. code-block:: text

        texlive-math-extra
        texlive-bibtex-extra
        texlive-xetex
        texlive-humanities
        texlive-pictures

Alternatively, one may pull in ``texlive-full`` to get all available
style files.

If you want to use the *anslistings* code environment with ``ptex2tex``
(``.ptex2tex.cfg`` styles ``Python_ANS``, ``Python_ANSt``, ``Cpp_ANS``, etc.) or
``doconce ptex2tex`` (``envir=ans`` or ``envir=ans:nt``), you need the
``anslistings.sty`` file. It can be obtained from
the `ptex2tex source <https://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex/source/browse/trunk/latex/styles/with_license/anslistings.sty>`_. It should get installed
by the ``cp2texmf.sh`` script executed above.

reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst`` output from DocOnce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

.. code-block:: text

        svn checkout \ 
          http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

The command

.. code-block:: text

        pip install sphinx

installs Docutils along with Sphinx and Pygments.

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
`rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>`_. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the ``rst2pdf`` directory and
run the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.

Sphinx Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Output to ``sphinx`` requires of course the
`Sphinx software <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_,
installed by

.. code-block:: text

        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

An alternative is

.. code-block:: text

        pip install sphinx

DocOnce comes with many Sphinx themes that are not part of the
standard Sphinx source distribution. Some of these themes require
additional Python/Sphinx modules to be installed:

 * cloud and redcloud: `<https://bitbucket.org/ecollins/cloud_sptheme>`_

 * bootstrap: `<https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme>`_

 * solarized: `<https://bitbucket.org/miiton/sphinxjp.themes.solarized>`_

 * impressjs: `<https://github.com/shkumagai/sphinxjp.themes.impressjs>`_

 * sagecellserver: `<https://github.com/kriskda/sphinx-sagecell>`_

These must be downloaded or cloned, and ``setup.py`` must be run as shown
above.

Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DocOnce format ``pandoc`` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the ``pandoc`` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

.. code-block:: text

        sudo apt-get install pandoc

on Debian (Ubuntu) systems.

Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is ``epydoc`` one needs that program too, installed
by

.. code-block:: text

        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..

**Remark.**
Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
``apt-get install`` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For ``svn`` directories, go to the directory,
run ``svn update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``. For
Mercurial (``hg``) directories, go to the directory, run
``hg pull; hg update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``.

Analyzing file differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``doconce diff file1 file prog`` command for illustrating differences between
two files ``file1`` and ``file2`` using the program ``prog`` requires ``prog``
to be installed. By default, ``prog`` is ``difflib`` which comes with Python
and is always present if you have DocOnce installed. Another choice, ``diff``,
should be available on all Unix/Linux systems. Other choices, their
URL, and their ``sudo apt-get install`` command on Debian (Ubuntu) systems
appear in the table below.
