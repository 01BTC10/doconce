======= A modest beginning =======

FIGURE: [line] This shape is commonly referred to a *straight line*. label{line}

Lines such as the one in figure ref{line} can be combined to form other shapes.

FIGURE: [square] This square is formed by four straight lines. label{square}

A grid can also be made from straight lines.

FIGURE: [grid] This is a grid with 5 x 5 cells

A circle, however, cannot be formed by a finite number of straight lines.

FIGURE: [circle] This circle is drawn in blue with a dashed line.


======= More advanced figures =======

FIGURE: [maze] A maze can be drawn by combining the elements above.

FIGURE: [graph] TikZ is quite well suited to draw graphs.


======= Plotting functions =======

TikZ can be used to plot functions. The next figure will be inlined.

FIGURE: [plot1]

FIGURE: [plot2] The functions can even be labeled!
