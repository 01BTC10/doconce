__Summary.__
Quick demo of how to make figures with TikZ in DocOnce.

======= Ideas =======

"TikZ": "http://www.math.uni-leipzig.de/~hellmund/LaTeX/pgf-tut.pdf"
is a very strong tool for making figures in LaTeX. DocOnce supports such
figures: if a figure file `myfig` exists in a version `myfig.tikz`,
DocOnce will, in case of `latex` or `pdflatex` output, utilize the
`myfig.tikz` figure directly. The problem is what do to with other
output formats. In HTML formats (`html` and `sphinx`),
one can use a corresponding SVG version of the figure,
and for more primitive formats, one needs a plain PNG
version. A utility script, `doconce tikz2fig` (?), can be used
to convert a TikZ figure to SVG or PNG format:

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce tikz2fig myfig.tikz
!ec
The result is `myfig.svg` and `myfig.png` to be stored along with `myfig.tikz`.



======= A modest beginning =======

FIGURE: [line] This shape is commonly referred to as a *straight line*. label{line}

Lines such as the one in figure ref{line} can be combined to form other shapes.

FIGURE: [square] This square is formed by four straight lines. label{square}

A grid can also be made from straight lines.

FIGURE: [grid] This is a grid with 5 x 5 cells

A circle, however, cannot be formed by a finite number of straight lines.

FIGURE: [circle] This circle is drawn in blue with a dashed line.

[kgh: filenames identical to words in the texts have been known to cause problems]

======= More advanced figures =======

FIGURE: [maze] A maze can be drawn by combining the elements above.

FIGURE: [graph] TikZ is quite well suited to draw graphs.


======= Plotting functions =======

TikZ can be used to plot functions. The next figure will be inlined.

FIGURE: [plot1]

FIGURE: [plot2] The functions can even be labeled!
