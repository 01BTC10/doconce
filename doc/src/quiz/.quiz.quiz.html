Good attempt, especially when referring to the following story.


\begin{quote}
An anthropologist was asking a primitive tribesman about arithmetic.
When the anthropologist asked, \emph{What does two and two make?} the
tribesman replied, \emph{Five.} Asked to explain, the tribesman said, \emph{If I
have a rope with two knots, and another rope with two knots, and I
join the ropes together, then I have five knots.}

The equation

\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0
\label{cont:eq}
\end{equation}
is famous in physics. Select the wrong assertion(s):


% --- begin keywords ---
['gradient', 'divergence', 'curl', 'vector calculus']
% --- end keywords ---
% --- end quiz question ---

% --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) ---
The equation tells that the net outflow of something with
velocity $\bm{u}$ in region is zero.
% --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 1 ---
This is right: integrating (\ref{cont:eq}) over an arbitrary domain
$\Omega$ and using Gauss' divergence theorem, we get the surface integral

\[ \int_{\partial\Omega}\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS=0,\]
where $\bm{n}$ is an outward unit normal on the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
The quantity $\bm{u}\cdot\bm{n}dS$ is the outflow of volume per
time unit if $\bm{u}$ is velocity.
% --- end explanation of choice 1 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) ---
The equation tells that the vector field $\bm{u}$ is divergence free.
% --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 2 ---
Yes, \emph{divergence free} is often used as synonym for \emph{zero divergence},
and $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}$ is the divergence of a vector field $\bm{u}$.
% --- end explanation of choice 2 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 3 (wrong) ---
The equation implies that there exists a vector potential $\bm{A}$
such that $\bm{u}=\nabla\times\bm{A}$.
% --- end quiz choice 3 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 3 ---
Yes, this is an important result in vector calculus that is much
used in electromagnetics.
% --- end explanation of choice 3 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 4 (right) ---
The equation implies $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.
% --- end quiz choice 4 (right) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 4 ---
No, only if $\bm{u}=\nabla\phi$, for some scalar potential $\phi$,
we have $\nabla\times\bm{u}=0$.
% --- end explanation of choice 4 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 5 (right) ---
The equation implies that $\bm{u}$ must be a constant vector field.
% --- end quiz choice 5 (right) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 5 ---
No, it is the \emph{sum} of derivatives of different components of $\bm{u}$
that is zero. Only in one dimension, where $\bm{u}=u_x\bm{i}$
and consequently $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=du/dx$, the vector field must be constant.

We want to create a Python list object of length \code{n} where each
element is \code{0}. Is the following code then what we need?

\bpycod
import numpy
mylist = numpy.zeros(n)
\epycod
% --- end quiz question ---

% --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) ---
Yes.
% --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 1 ---
Not exactly: \code{numpy.zeros} creates an array of zeros, not a list.
% --- end explanation of choice 1 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) ---
Yes, provided we write \code{np} instead of \code{numpy}:

\bpycod
import numpy as np
mylist = np.zeros(n)
\epycod
% --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 2 ---
No, this is fully equivalent to the original code, so \code{mylist} becomes
an array, not a list.
% --- end explanation of choice 2 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 3 (right) ---
No.
% --- end quiz choice 3 (right) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 3 ---
One would need to do \code{mylist = [0]*n} or \code{numpy.zeros(n).tolist()}.

The purpose of this program is to differentiate the two mathematical
functions

\begin{align*}
u(t) &= t^2,\\
f(x) &= 2x.
\end{align*}
Determine which of the following assertions that is \textbf{wrong}.
% --- end quiz question ---

% --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) ---
In Python, the syntax for $t^2$ is \code{t**2}, not \code{t^2}, so the
\code{u} function contains an error.
% --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 1 ---
True. However, \code{t^2} will work for integer \code{t} in Python, but the computation is nonsense in this case since $u(t)$ is supposed to be $t^2$.
% --- end explanation of choice 1 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) ---
The string in the \code{u} function is a valid doc string.
% --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 2 ---
Yes, a doc string can be any string after the function heading. It can
have single quotes \code{'...'}, double quotes \code{"..."},
triple single quotes \code{'''...'''}, or triple double quotes \code{"""..."""}.
The latter is the most popular for doc strings. Recall that triple quotes
allow the string to span multiple lines.
% --- end explanation of choice 2 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 3 (wrong) ---
The output from the program is on a single line, despite two \code{print}
statements.
% --- end quiz choice 3 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 3 ---
Yes, because of the comma after the first \code{print} statement: it suppresses
the newline character that is normally appended to \code{print} statements in
Python.
% --- end explanation of choice 3 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 4 (right) ---
One cannot use \code{u} both inside the \code{D} function and in the
outer calling code (the main program).
% --- end quiz choice 4 (right) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 4 ---
Yes, you can, because the \code{u} argument in the \code{D} function
(holding a function)
is a \emph{local} variable inside the \code{D} function. The \code{u} in the calling
code is \emph{global} variable, holding a function object.
Inside \code{D}, \code{u} refers to the
local variable, while in the main program, \code{u} refers to the
global variable, and the local variable \code{u} in \code{D} no longer exists, because
it was deleted when returning from the function.
Inside \code{D}, we can actually access the global \code{u} by \code{globals()['u']},
but that almost never comes to use and is also bad coding.
% --- end explanation of choice 4 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 5 (wrong) ---
The call \code{D(lambda x: return 2*x, 2)} is equivalent to defining

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return 2*x

\epycod
and then calling \code{D(f, 2)}.
% --- end quiz choice 5 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 5 ---
\code{f(x)} is defined as a lambda function, which is a short-hand for
defining functions as an expression, in a function call as here, or
in the right-hand side of an assignment, e.g.,

\bpycod
f = lambda x: return 2*x
\epycod
% --- end explanation of choice 5 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 6 (wrong) ---
There is danger of integer division in the \code{D} function.
% --- end quiz choice 6 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 6 ---
True, here is an example: \code{D(lambda t: t, dt=1)}. We get
\code{(t+1 - t-1)/(2*1)}, which for any integer \code{t} gives \code{int/int}
and hence integer division.
% --- end explanation of choice 6 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 7 (wrong) ---
The \code{D} function computes an approximate derivative of the
function \code{u(t)}.
% --- end quiz choice 7 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 7 ---
Yes, \code{D} applies a widely used finite difference approximation
formula to the derivative.
% --- end explanation of choice 7 ---

% --- begin quiz choice 8 (wrong) ---
Both calls to \code{D} results in the exact derivative, provided we
replace \code{t^2} by \code{t**2}.
% --- end quiz choice 8 (wrong) ---

% --- begin explanation of choice 8 ---
Yes, the finite difference approximation used in \code{D} is exact
for quadratic polynomials!
