TITLE: A Software Tool for Typesetting Quizzes

__Summary.__ This note describes a system for writing quizzes
(multiple-choice questions) in a compact text format. The
format can be automatically translated to HTML and also rendered
as nicely typeset quizzes in web pages.

!split
======= A pure text quiz =======

===== Question and choices =====

Here is a typical quiz with a question and four alternative answers:

!bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?
Cw: Helsinki
Cw: Drammen
Cr: Oslo
Cw: Denmark
!equiz
Click on the symbol to the left of _Choice_ to see whether the choice is
correct or not.

The above quiz can be specified by the text

!bc
|bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?
Cw: Helsinki
Cw: Drammen
Cr: Oslo
Cw: Denmark
|equiz
!ec

!bnotice Syntax

 * The quiz is specified between `!bquiz`
   (``begin quiz'') and `!equiz` (``end quiz'') tags.
 * The question starts right after `Q:`.
 * Wrong choices are specified with `Cw:`, and right choices with `Cr:`.
 * The instructions `!bquiz`, `!equiz`, `Q:`, `Cw:`, and `Cr:` must appear
   at the beginning of a line.
 * The text of (e.g.) a wrong answer (`Cr:`) lasts up to the next
   instruction (like `Cw:`, `Cr:`, `!equiz`).
 * One can have as many wrong and right
   choices as desired.

===== Explanations of choices =====

Sometimes it is desireable to give some explanation why certain choices
are wrong (or right).
If you click on the symbols in the quiz below, explanations
will be shown for Choices 1 and 2.

!bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?

Cw: Helsinki
E: Helsinki is the capital of Finland.

Cw: Drammen
E: Drammen is a small city close to Oslo.

Cr: Oslo

Cw: Denmark
!equiz
The corresponding typesetting applies `E: ...` after the choice to
give an explanation of that choice.

!bc
|bquiz
Q: What is the capital of Norway?

Cw: Helsinki
E: Helsinki is the capital of Finland.

Cw: Drammen
E: Drammen is a small city close to Oslo.

Cr: Oslo

Cw: Denmark
|equiz
!ec
This time we also added some spaces for enhanced reading of the text.

===== Typesetting =====

It is easy to use *emphasize font*, _boldface_, color{red}{color},
"hyperlinks": "http://google.com", etc.,
since the text in the specification of questions, choices,
and explanations are rendered according to the
"Doconce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" markup language.
For simple typesetting (emphasize, boldface, links) Doconce also
accepts Markdown syntax.
Here is an example:

!bquiz
Q: Here is a famous quote:

!bquote
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*
!equote
This quote is attributed to

Cw: Geroge W. Bush

Cr: Donald Knuth
E: According to "Wikiquote": "http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth",
Donald Knuth wrote this statement in *Structured Programming with
Goto Statements*. Computing Surveys, _6_:4,
pp. 261-301, _1974_.

Cw: Ole-Johan Dahl
E: Ole-Johan Dahl was a famous Norwegian professor of computer
science and together with Kristen Nygaard the inventor of
object-oriented programming, but he is not the man behind this
quote.
!equiz

The corresponding specification reads

!bc
|bquiz
Q: Here is a famous quote:

|bquote
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*
|equote
This quote is attributed to

Cw: Geroge W. Bush

Cr: Donald Knuth
E: According to "Wikiquote": "http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth",
Donald Knuth wrote this statement in *Structured Programming with
Goto Statements*. Computing Surveys, _6_:4,
pp. 261-301, _1974_.

Cw: Ole-Johan Dahl
E: Ole-Johan Dahl was a famous Norwegian professor of computer
science and together with Kristen Nygaard the inventor of
object-oriented programming, but he is not the man behind this
quote.
|equiz
!ec

===== Specification in HTML =====

Instead of using the compact text specification with Doconce
formatting, one can use a more verbose syntax and specify everything
in HTML. The previous example then reads

## Note that the HTML text is indented such that it is not interpreted
## as a quiz by Doconce.

!bc htmlcod
 <!-- --- begin quiz --- -->
 <!-- --- begin quiz question --- -->
 Here is a famous quote:

 <blockquote>
     <em>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</em>
 </blockquote>

 This quote is attributed to
 <!-- --- end quiz question --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->
 Geroge W. Bush
 <!-- --- end quiz choice 1 (wrong) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 2 (right) --- -->
 Donald Knuth
 <!-- --- end quiz choice 2 (right) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin explanation of choice 2 --- -->
 According to
 <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth"
  target="_self">Wikiquote</a>,
 Donald Knuth wrote this statement in <em>Structured Programming with
 Goto Statements</em>. Computing Surveys, <b>6</b>:4,
 pp. 261-301, <b>1974</b>.
 <!-- --- end explanation of choice 2 --- -->

 <!-- --- begin quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->
 Ole-Johan Dahl
 <!-- --- end quiz choice 3 (wrong) --- -->

 <!-- --- begin explanation of choice 3 --- -->
 Ole-Johan Dahl was a famous Norwegian professor of computer science
 and together with Kristen Nygaard the inventor of object-oriented
 programming, but he is not the man behind this quote.
 <!-- --- end explanation of choice 3 --- -->
 <!-- --- end quiz --- -->
!ec
This syntax applies begin-end comments to mark the start and end
of the question, the choices, and the explanations.

!bwarning
The HTML specification of a quiz is not a meaningful HTML code for
displaying the quiz in a browser, it is just an application of the
HTML language to specify information and have full control of
the typesetting details. Some program must interpret the
HTML above and typset questions, choices, and explanations adequately.
