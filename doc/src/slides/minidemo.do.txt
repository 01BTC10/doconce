===== Starting point: basic math =====

!bblock Why Python?
Python is better than Matlab and C++ are for those with too much
spare time.
!eblock

Let's add!

!bt
\[ a + b = c \]
!et

!bc pypro
a = 2
b = 3
c = a + b
print c
!ec

===== Moving on: breathtaking graphics =====

Let's plot!

!bt
\[ f(x) = e^{-x^2} \]
!et

!bc pypro
from numpy import linspace, exp
from matplotlib.pyplot import plot, show
x = linspace(-4, 4, 101)
y = exp(-x**2)
plot(x, y)
show()
!ec
