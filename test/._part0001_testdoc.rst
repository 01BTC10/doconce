*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
.. is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

.. _sec1:


Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2


  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line



..

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote.

Here is a reference to Equation :ref:`(3.3) <Eq:my:eq1>`.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.
