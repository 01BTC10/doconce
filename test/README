This directory contains the primary doconce tests.
All tests are classical regression tests where text is
generated in many files, these are concatenated, and then
compared with the big reference file test.r.
The tests are run by

  python test.verify

A diff test.v test.r show differences of generated text
(test.v) and reference data (test.r).

Dependencies for the test problems run by test.verify are
basically all software that doconce depends on, see
installation instructions in ../doc/pub/manual/manual.html.
