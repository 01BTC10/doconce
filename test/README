This directory contains the primary doconce tests.
All tests are classical regression tests where text is
generated in many files, these are concatenated, and then
compared with the big reference file test.r.
The tests are run by

  python test.verify

A diff test.v test.r show differences of generated text
(test.v) and reference data (test.r).

Note that standard unit tests with nose are less suitable
for a text transformation program such as doconce. The
reason is that some functionality must be tested in larger
files where many constructions play together. Also, test
files are frequently changed to add new constructions,
leading to signficant differences from the reference text,
and approval of the result must be done by the human eye.
This is more conveniently done by looking at one or a few
larger files of differences rather than many small ones.

Dependencies for the test problems run by test.verify are
basically all software that doconce depends on, see
installation instructions in ../doc/pub/manual/manual.html.
