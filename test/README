This directory contains the primary doconce tests.
All tests are classical regression tests where text is
generated in many files, these are concatenated, and then
compared with the big reference file test.r.
The tests are run by

  python test.verify

A diff test.v test.r show differences of generated text
(test.v) and reference data (test.r).

Note that standard unit tests with nose/pytest are less suitable for a
text transformation program such as doconce. The reason is that some
functionality must be tested in larger files where many constructions
play together. Also, test files are frequently changed to add new
constructions, or test the effect of bug fixes, leading to a substantial
evolution of the reference text. At least for a small project as
DocOnce, this has turned out to be the most feasible testing approach.
Basically, `python test.verify` is run and `test.v` is compared against
`test.r` in a diff program, using the human eye. Many updates lead to
significant changes in the diff, so automating the acceptance of new
remains a future project.

Dependencies for the test problems run by test.verify are
basically all software that doconce depends on, see
installation instructions in ../doc/pub/manual/manual.html.
