TITLE: How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory & University of Oslo
DATE: today


This document is translated to the format _${FORMAT}_. The purpose is to
test LaTeX math in DocOnce with various output formats.

__Test 1: Inline math.__ We can get an inline equation
`$u(t)=e^{-at}$` rendered as $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

__Test 2: A single equation with label.__ An equation with number,

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1a}\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looks like

!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1a}\end{equation}
!et
Maybe this multi-line version is what we actually prefer to write:

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at}
label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
|et
!ec
The result is the same:

!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation through its label `eq1b`: (ref{eq1b}).


__Test 3: Multiple, aligned equations without label and number.__ MathJax has
historically had some problems with rendering many LaTeX math environments,
but the `align*` and `align` environments have always worked.

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
Result:

!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et

__Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations with label.__ Here, we
use `align` with user-prescribed labels:

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
Result:

!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2b})-(ref{eq3b}).

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
!bwarning Warning: align/alignat environments with labels are anti-aligned!
Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but DocOnce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is

!bc rst
.. math::
   :label: eq2b

        u(t)=e^{-at}


.. math::
   :label: eq3b

        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}

!ec
!ewarning

If DocOnce had not rewritten the equation it would be rendered in
${FORMAT} as

## NOTE: These math blocks, not inside !bt-!et directives will result
## in error messages from DocOnce. But if we neglect them, the code works
## as intended.

.. math::

        \begin{align}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}
        \label{eq2b}\\
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        \label{eq3b}
        \end{align}
# #endif

# #if FORMAT == "pandoc"
!bwarning Fixes are needed for DocOnce to Pandoc to HTML
Original Pandoc-extended Markdown transformed to HTML via Pandoc
does not work with labels and multiple equations. `doconce md2html`
fixes the trouble by adding full support for MathJax and avoiding
that eqref references become empty.

One can write with align and labels in the DocOnce document and get excellent
output in LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, and Markdown-based HTML. Without
`doconce md2html` one must accept that labeles have very limited support
compared to more advanced MathJax.

__Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations without label.__ In LaTeX,
equations within an `align` environment is automatically given numbers.
To ensure that an HTML document with MathJax gets the same equation numbers
as its LaTeX companion, DocOnce generates labels in equations where
there is no label prescribed. For example,

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
is edited to something like

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{_auto5}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{_auto6}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
and the HTML output gets the two equation numbered.

!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align}
!et

__Test 6: Multiple, aligned equations with multiple alignments.__
The `align` environment can be used with two `&` alignment characters, e.g.,

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u, & x\in (0,L),
\ t\in (0,T]\\
u(0,t) &= u_0(x), & x\in [0,L]
\end{align}
|et
!ec
The result becomes

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u, & x\in (0,L),
\ t\in (0,T]\\
u(0,t) &= u_0(x), & x\in [0,L]
\end{align}
!et

A better solution is usually to use an `alignat` environment:

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u, & x\in (0,L),
\ t\in (0,T]\\
u(0,t) &= u_0(x), & x\in [0,L]
\end{alignat}
|et
!ec
with the rendered result

!bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u, & x\in (0,L),
\ t\in (0,T]\\
u(0,t) &= u_0(x), & x\in [0,L]
\end{alignat}
!et
# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "ipynb", "pandoc")
!bwarning align/alignat environments with equation numbers are anti-aligned!
In the `sphinx`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc` output formats, DocOnce rewrites
the equations in an `alignat` environment as individual equations in
`equation` environments (or more precisely, `sphinx` can work with
`alignat*` so only numbered `alignat` equations get rewritten as individual
equations). If the alignment is somewhat important, try the best with a
manual rewrite in terms of separate `equation` environments, and stick to
`align*` and `alignat*` in `sphinx`.
!ewarning
# #endif

# #if FORMAT in ("pandoc", "ipynb")
If we did not do the rewrite of the above equation it would be
rendered in ${FORMAT} as

$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u, & x\in (0,L),
\ t\in (0,T]\\
u(0,t) &= u_0(x), & x\in [0,L]
\end{alignat}
$$
# #elif FORMAT in ("sphinx")
If we did not do the rewrite of the above equation it would be
rendered in Sphinx as

.. math::

        \begin{alignat}{2}
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u, & x\in (0,L),
        \ t\in (0,T]\\
        u(0,t) &= u_0(x), & x\in [0,L]
        \end{alignat}

Clearly, Sphinx is not capable of rendering this.
# #endif





__Test 7: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.__ Let us
try the old `eqnarray*` environment.

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

__Test 8: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.__
Here use `eqnarray` with labels:

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2c})-(ref{eq3c})
in the ${FORMAT} format?
# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
No, unfortunately not.
Note: DocOnce takes the `eqnarray` environment
with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code

!bc rst
.. math::

        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\
        v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
!ec
That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.

With no rewrite of `eqnarray` environments for sphinx, the above equation
would be rendered as

.. math::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
        \end{eqnarray}

# #endif

__Test 9: The `multiline` environment with label and number.__
The LaTeX code

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{multline}
\int_a^b f(x)dx = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2} h(f(a+jh) +
f(a+(j+1)h)) \\
=\frac{h}{2}f(a) + \frac{h}{2}f(b) + \sum_{j=1}^n f(a+jh)
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
|et
!ec
gets rendered as

!bt
\begin{multline}
\int_a^b f(x)dx = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2} h(f(a+jh) +
f(a+(j+1)h)) \\
=\frac{h}{2}f(a) + \frac{h}{2}f(b) + \sum_{j=1}^n f(a+jh)
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
!et
and we can hopefully refer to the Trapezoidal rule
as the formula (ref{multiline:eq1}).

__Test 10: Splitting equations using `split`.__
Although `align` can be used to split too long equations, a more obvious
command is `split`:

!bc latexcod
|bt
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int_a^b f(x)dx = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2} h(f(a+jh) +
f(a+(j+1)h)) \\
=\frac{h}{2}f(a) + \frac{h}{2}f(b) + \sum_{j=1}^n f(a+jh)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
|et
!ec
The result becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int_a^b f(x)dx = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2} h(f(a+jh) +
f(a+(j+1)h)) \\
=\frac{h}{2}f(a) + \frac{h}{2}f(b) + \sum_{j=1}^n f(a+jh)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et

__Test 11: Newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.__
We have

!bt
\[ {\color{blue}\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using `\bm`:

!bt
\[ {\color{blue}\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

# #if FORMAT in ("html", "sphinx", "pandoc", "ipynb")
Note: for the ${FORMAT} format, `\bm` was substituted by DocOnce
to `\boldsymbol`.
# #endif
