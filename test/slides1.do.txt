Here we have a paragraph to pop up in red.
And a line more

[hpl: Here are some notes that can go to notes typesetting
in the slide environment.]

!bnotes
One can also have ordinary notes.
Over multiple lines.

===== Some math and computer code =====

## Command and [] used to be problematic in blocks, check that it is ok

!bblock A simple, mathematical formula where $t\in [0,\pi]$:
!bt
\[ f(x,y,t) = e^{-xt}\sin\pi y \]
!et
!eblock

!bblock Bash demanded more of DocOnce than Python, so let's do Bash:
First, inline `$? != 0`, then comments with dollar variables (and minted
style):

!bc shcod
var=10
# $1, $2, ... are command-line args
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then   # $? reflects success or not
  echo "Great!"
fi
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Various admon blocks =====

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

!bnotice (large) Key PDE:
This box has title and math in large font:
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \]
!et
!enotice

!bpop
!bsummary None
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
!esummary
!epop

!bwarning (small)
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.
