__Abstract.__
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

# Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
# is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

======= Section 1 =======
label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist
    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2
  * and perhaps an ordered sublist
    o first item
    o second item,
      continuing on a new line

__Here is a list with paragraph heading.__

  * item1
  * item2

=== Here is a list with subsubsection heading ===

  * item1
  * item2

!bquote
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote for testing *emphasized words* and _boldface words_,
also with hypens:
*pre*-fix, post-*fix*, _pre_-fix, post-_fix_.
!equote

Here are two references. Equation~(ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.
# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html")
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.
# #endif


===== Subsection 1 =====
label{subsec1}

idx{`somefunc` function}

# Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
# and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section ref{sec1} and ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections    ref{subsec1} and ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises ref{demo:ex:1} and ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices     ref{app1} and ref{app2} are also nice elements.

=== Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence ===

Section ref{subsec1} is fine.
Section ref{subsubsec:ex} too.


# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

=== Computer code ===

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f fromto: subroutine@
and then just the subroutine,
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f from-to:a comment@^C\s+END1
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(`envir=ccq`):
@@@CODE ../doc/src/manual/__testcode.f envir=ccq

Testing other code environments. First Python:

!bc
|bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
|ec
!ec
which gets rendered as

!bc pycod-t
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec

# #if FORMAT not in ("rst", "plain", "epytext", "st")
Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

__Paragraph heading before code.__

!bc pycod-t
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
!ec

=== Subsubsection heading before code ===

!bc pycod-t
def h(z):
    return z+1
!ec
# #endif

# #if FORMAT in ("sphinx", "html", "latex", "pdflatex")
Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:
# #else
Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.
# #endif

!bc pyoptpro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
!ec

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:
# #else
Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).
# #endif

!bc pyscpro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
!ec

## Should also test that one can read .pyopt and .pysc programs

Then Cython:
!bc cycod-t
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
!ec

Standard Python shell sessions:

!bc pyshell
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
!ec

IPython sessions:

!bc ipy
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
!ec


# This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
!bc cpppro-t
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
!ec
# The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
# It also tests emoji before code
And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:

!bc
|bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
|ec
!ec
which then is typeset as

!bc cod-t
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec

HTML:

!bc htmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
!ec

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
`<a href="` (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

!bc sys-t
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
!ec

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

!bc
|bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
|ec
!ec
results in

!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec

# Here goes hidden code.
# Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.

!bc pyhid
def f(x):
    """Secret, hidden function to be defined."""
    return 42
!ec

!bc fhid
       subroutine helper1(x)
       real*8 x
       x = 42
       return

       subroutine helper2(x)
       real*8 x
       x = 43
       return
!ec

Finally, `!bc do` supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

!bc do
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

|bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
|ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

|bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
|et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
!ec

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! For
spellcheck, test `a verbatim expression` in `another` in a `third`.
Also test exclamation mark as in `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `a != b`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}`.

# #if FORMAT not in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html")
The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format ${FORMAT}.
# #endif
Here is some color{red}{red color} and an attempt to write color{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak<linebreak>
code.} Some formats will only display <linebreak>
this correctly when `html` <linebreak>
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

=== Running OS commands ===

@@@OSCMD python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'

=== Footnotes ===

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 * even with math $\nabla^2u$[^math1]
 * and code `h[i] += 1`[^code]
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)
 * and "links": "http://google.com"[^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: URL: "google.com" is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

!bnotice Non-breaking space character
This paragraph aims to test "non-breaking space character":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space", and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~"link": "http://google.com"~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in `[~x for x in y]` or in `y=~x`, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
!enotice

===== Subsection 2: Testing figures =====
label{subsec:ex}
idx{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. label{fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]

idx{movies}


# Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long
caption spanning
several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`
as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. label{myfig}

# Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

# #if FORMAT in ("html", "sphinx")
Test SVG figure:

FIGURE: [http://openclipart.org/people/jpneok/junebug.svg, width=200]
# #endif

# Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs
# #if FORMAT == "mwiki"
FIGURE: [testfigs/df_plot.png, width=800] This is a wikimedia figure file.

# Non-uploaded file with no caption
FIGURE: [testfigs/df2s8765s_plot.png, width=200, frac=0.4]
# #endif


__Remark.__
Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


# Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

===== The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?) =====
label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
!bc
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
!ec

__More on $\theta$.__ Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}
!et

Or with align with label and numbers:

!bt
\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
!et

% if FORMAT == "sphinx":
Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.
% endif
% if FORMAT == "mwiki":
The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.
% endif

===== Custom Environments =====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.


===== Tables =====
label{subsec:table}

idx{test index with `verbatim text` which is possible}
idx{test `two` (separate) `verbatim expressions` which is also possible}
idx{index with!subindex}

# index with comma could fool sphinx
idx{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in LaTeX, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
label{mytab}
}

% endif

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\end{table}
% endif

The DocOnce source code reads
!bc ccq

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

!ec

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 1.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 3.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

|--------------------------|
|$i$|$h_i$|$\bar T_i$|`L_i`|
|-l-----r-------r----r-----|
|0   |0     |288   |-0.0065|
|1   |11,000|216   |0.0	   |
|2   |20,000|216   |0.001  |
|3   |32,000|228   |0.0028 |
|4   |47,000|270   |0.0	   |
|5   |51,000|270   |-0.0028|
|6   |71,000|214   |`NaN`  |
|--------------------------|

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):
## +`v_2` does not work, need space + `v_2`

|-----------------------------------------|
| exact | `v_1`   |$a_i$ + `v_2`|`verb_3_`|
|---r--------r---------r-----------r------|
|9      | 9.62    | 5.57      |  8.98     |
|-20    | -23.39  | -7.65     | -19.93    |
|10     | 17.74   | -4.50     |  9.96     |
|0      | -9.19   | 4.13      | -0.26     |
|-----------------------------------------|

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

|-----------------------------|
| $S$         | command       |
|-----l---------------r-------|
| $||a_0||$   | `norm|length` |
| $x\cap y$   | `x|y`         |
|-----------------------------|
# #if FORMAT == 'plain'

NOTE: The above table is not correctly handled in the plain text format
because in this format inline verbatim text look like normal text,
and the first line in the table then looks like three columns.
# #endif

Finally, a table with math
# #if FORMAT in ("rst", "html", "sphinx", "pandoc")
(`bm` that expands to `boldsymbol`, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
# #endif
and URLs.

# Mako code to expand URLs in the table

===== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` =====

__Paragraph with verbatim and math: `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.__ Here is more `__verbatim__` code and
some plain text on a new line.

# Test various types of headlines
% for heading in ('_Just bold_', '*Just emphasize*', '`Just verbatim`', '_Bold_ beginning', '*Emphasize* beginning', '`Verbatim` beginning', 'Maybe _bold end_', 'Maybe *emphasize end*', 'Maybe `verbatim end`', 'The middle has _bold_ word', 'The middle has *emphasize* word', 'The middle has `verbatim` word'):
===== ${heading} =====

Some text.

% endfor
% for heading in ('*Just emphasize*', '`Just verbatim`', '*Emphasize* beginning', '`Verbatim beginning`', 'Maybe *emphasize end*', 'Maybe `verbatim end`', 'The middle has *emphasize* word', 'The middle has `verbatim` word'):

__${heading}.__ Some text.

% endfor

__Ampersand.__
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H & M, but written
as `Hennes & Mauritz` and `H & M`.
A sole `&` must also work.
# Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

!bc
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
!ec

__Quotes.__
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like `.txt`.


===== Bibliography test =====

Here is an example: cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work cite{Langtangen_1988d} and cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book cite{Langtangen:91} and the
cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.


===== Example: Examples can be typeset as exercises =====
label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


!bsubex
State some problem.

!bsol
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
State some other problem.

!bhint
A hint can be given.
!ehint

!bhint
Maybe even another hint?
!ehint

!bsol
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.
!esol
!esubex

===== User-defined environments =====

def refex(label, capital=False):
    if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex'):
        return 'Example ref{%s}' % label
    else:
        s = 'The ' if capital else 'the '
        s += 'example in Section ref{%s}' % label

${refex('ex:test:1p1', capital=True)} demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function `add` appears in
${refex('ex:test:1p1')}.

!bu-example A test function label=ex:test:1p1
Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

!bc pycod
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
!ec
!eu-example

!bu-example Addition label=ex:math:1p1

!et
!eu-example

!bu-highlight Highlight box!
This environment is used to highlight something:

!bt
\[ E = mc^2 \]
!et

===== URLs =====
label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl", or
the entire URL if desired, "URL": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".  Here is a
plain file link "URL": "testdoc.do.txt", or "url":"testdoc.do.txt", or
URL: "testdoc.do.txt" or url : "testdoc.do.txt" or "a link with
newline": "testdoc.do.txt". Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl" or "hpl" :
"http://folk.uio.no/hpl". Also `file:///` works: "link to a
file":"file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" is
fine to have. Moreover, ``loose'' URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or just a "mail link": "mailto:hpl@simula.no", or a raw URL: "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
"Newton-Cotes":
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" formulas
and a "good book":
"http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1". Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas"
and URL: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
"`decay_mod`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py", "`ball1.py`": "http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py",
and "`ball2.py`": "http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py".


# Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
# format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

# Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
# if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
# if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
"google": "http://google.com", "google": "http://google.com", and
"google": "http://google.com", which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

===== Test of Some LaTeX Fixes =====

Let's check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.  2 which is also often used.
Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen, or maybe also prof.  Ting,
will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr.    Hansen is doing together
with Ms. Larsen. A reference like Sec. ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch. ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App. ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no. $i$ of DocOnce features.
Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. ref{mytab}.
Percentage must be fixed: 7%,  87.65% and
50% at the beginning of the line.

======= LaTeX Mathematics =======

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
!bt
\[ a = b + c \]
!et
or with number and label, as in (ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation by (ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
!et


% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', 'html', 'pandoc'):
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 label{eq1} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
!bt
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
!et
Testing split:
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to the last equation by (ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
!bt
\begin{gather}
a = b \\
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
!et

Testing alignat:
!bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 label{eq1a} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
!et
Let us refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (ref{eq1a})-(ref{eq2a}), and to (ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

let the program count the number of heads.

!bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
!ehint

!bhint
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.

=== My remarks ===

Remarks with such a subsubsection is treated as more text
after the last subexercise. Test a list too:

===== Not an exercise =====

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

===== Exercise: Test of plain text exercise =====
label{my:exer1}
file=myexer1.py

Very short exercise. What is the capital
of Norway?

===== Project: Compute a Probability =====

# Minimalistic exercise

label{demo:ex:2}

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

!bhint
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.
!ehint

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

 o item1
 o item2

===== Project: Explore Distributions of Random Circles =====

label{proj:circle1}
file=circles.pdf

The formula for a circle is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
!et
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

!bc pypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
!ec

# Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
# which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.

!bsubex

===== {Exercise}: Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix =====

# Another minimalistic exercise

Just some text. And some math saying that $e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

!bt
\[ \exp{(0)} = 1 \]
!et

And a test that the code `lambda x: x+2` is correctly placed here:

!bc

===== Exercise: Solution of differential equation =====
label{sec:this:exer:de}


!bquiz
H: SOlution of differential equation
K: derivatives; exponential function; equation, differential; differential equation
Q: Given

!bt
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 \]
!et
What is the solution of this equation?

L: quiz:diff:eq1

Cr: $y=e^{-y}$

Cw: $y=e^{y}$
E: Almost, but the sign is wrong (note the minus!).

Cw:
!bc pycod
from math import exp
def f(x):
    return exp(x)
!ec

E: Ooops, forgot a minus: `exp(-x)`, otherwise this Python code
must be considered as a good answer. It is more natural,
though, to write the solution to the problem
in mathematical notation:

!bt
\[ y(x) = e^{-y}.\]
!et

Cw: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.
E: Equations with derivatives can be solved;
they are termed *differential
equations*.

Cw: The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for $x$ or $y$, not a function $y(x)$.
E: Equations where the unknown is a function, as $y(x)$
here, are called *differential equations*, and are solved by
special techniques.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "Script for Introduction to Version Control":
"http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

!esummary

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "Dropbox":
"http://dropbox.com" and "Google Drive": "http://drive.google.com".
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


===== Appendix: Testing inline comments =====

# Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion:
not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp:
Simply go to URL:"http://dropbox.com" and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

# Test horizontal rule

# Coments for editing

First[add: ,] consider a quantity $Q$. [edit: To this end, -> We note that]
$Q>0$, because [del: a] negative [edit: quantity is -> quantities
are] [del: just] negative. [add: This comes as no surprise.]

===== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` =====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

!bquote
*Fun is fun.*--- Unknown.
!equote

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

[^example-of-the-third-footnote]: Not much to add here, but the footnote
is at the end with only one newline.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade {\LaTeX} (from DocOnce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}

\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with paragraph heading.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with subsubsection heading.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote for testing \emph{emphasized words} and \textbf{boldface words},
also with hypens:
\emph{pre}-fix, post-\emph{fix}, \textbf{pre}-fix, post-\textbf{fix}.
\end{quote}


Here are two references. Equation~(\ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(\ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (\ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.


\subsection{Subsection 1}
\label{subsec1}

\index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.

\paragraph{Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence.}
Section~\ref{subsec1} is fine.
Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex} too.


% sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(\Verb!envir=ccq!):
\bccq
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\eccq

Testing other code environments. First Python:

\bccq
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\eccq
which gets rendered as

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

\paragraph{Paragraph heading before code.}

\bpycod
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
\epycod

\paragraph{Subsubsection heading before code.}
\bpycod
def h(z):
    return z+1
\epycod

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\bpypro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\epypro
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\bpypro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\epypro


Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

Standard Python shell sessions:

\bpyshell
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\epyshell

IPython sessions:

\bipy
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\eipy


% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
% It also tests emoji before code
And a little bit of Fortran: (\Verb!dizzy_face!)

\bccq
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\eccq
which then is typeset as

\bcod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\ecod

HTML:

\bhtmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\ehtmlcod

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
\Verb!<a href="! (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

\bccq
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
\eccq
results in

\brestructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
\erestructuredtext

% Here goes hidden code.
% Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.





Finally, \Verb?!bc do? supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

\bdo
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
\edo

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! For
spellcheck, test \Verb!a verbatim expression! in \Verb!another! in a \Verb!third!.
Also test exclamation mark as in \Verb?!bc? and \Verb?!ec? as well as \Verb?a != b?.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}!.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red color} and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak\\
code.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when \Verb!html! \\
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
\bsys
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
\esys


\paragraph{Footnotes.}
Here is a test of footnotes \footnote{Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format. Plain text does nothing, {\LaTeX} removes the definition and inserts the footnote as part of the {\LaTeX} text. reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.}, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

\begin{itemize}
 \item list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 \item even with math $\nabla^2u$\footnote{Math footnotes can be dangerous since it interferes with an exponent.}

 \item and code \Verb!h[i] += 1!\footnote{One-line footnote.}
   (\emph{must} have space between inline code and footnote!)

 \item and \href{{http://google.com}}{links}\footnote{\href{{google.com}}{\nolinkurl{google.com}} is perhaps the most famous web site today.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third\footnote{Not much to add here, but the footnote is at the end with only one newline.} example.





Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Non-breaking space character.]
This paragraph aims to test \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space}}{non-breaking space character}, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~\href{{http://google.com}}{link}~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in \Verb![~x for x in y]! or in \Verb!y=~x!, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
  \caption{
  Visualization of a wave. \label{fig:impact}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}



\index{movies}


% Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v2! as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{downloaded_figures/f_plot.png}}




% Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


\paragraph{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file \Verb!movies.do.txt!.


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\bccq
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\eccq

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
2.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
4.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The DocOnce source code reads
\bccq

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

\eccq

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{l}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
1.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
3.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!L\_i! } \\
\hline
0   & 0      & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1   & 11,000 & 216        & 0.0        \\
2   & 20,000 & 216        & 0.001      \\
3   & 32,000 & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4   & 47,000 & 270        & 0.0        \\
5   & 51,000 & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6   & 71,000 & 214        & \Verb!NaN! \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \Verb!|-! because of a negative number,
and \Verb!|! right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!v\_1! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \Verb!v\_2! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!verb\_3\_! } \\
\hline
9     & 9.62       & 5.57               & 8.98           \\
-20   & -23.39     & -7.65              & -19.93         \\
10    & 17.74      & -4.50              & 9.96           \\
0     & -9.19      & 4.13               & -0.26          \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $S$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ command } \\
\hline
$ ||a_0|| $ & \Verb!norm|length! \\
$x\cap y$   & \Verb!x|y!         \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

% Mako code to expand URLs in the table
% (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
 \\
\hline
$\mathcal{L}=0$         & \includegraphics[width=2cm]{../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0080.png} & \includegraphics[width=2cm]{../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0085.png} \\
$a=b$                   & \includegraphics[width=2cm]{../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0090.png} & \includegraphics[width=2cm]{../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0095.png} \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2! }

\paragraph{Paragraph with verbatim and math: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1.py! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2.py! define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is more \Verb!__verbatim__! code and
some plain text on a new line.

% Test various types of headlines
\subsection{\textbf{Just bold}}

Some text.

\subsection{\emph{Just emphasize}}

Some text.

\subsection{\protect\Verb!Just verbatim! }

Some text.

\subsection{\textbf{Bold} beginning}

Some text.

\subsection{\emph{Emphasize} beginning}

Some text.


\paragraph{The middle has \emph{emphasize} word.}
Some text.


\paragraph{The middle has \protect\Verb!verbatim! word.}
Some text.


\paragraph{Ampersand.}
We can test Hennes {\&} Mauritz, often abbreviated H{\&}M, but written
as \Verb!Hennes & Mauritz! and \Verb!H & M!.
A sole \Verb!&! must also work.
% Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

\bccq
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
\eccq

\paragraph{Quotes.}
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct {\LaTeX} formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like \Verb!.txt!.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:

\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Examples can be typeset as exercises}

\label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with \Verb!Example:!
and then, with the command-line option \Verb!--examples_as_exercises! be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

% --- end exercise ---


\subsection{User-defined environments}



Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1} demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function \Verb!add! appears in
Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1}.


\begin{example}
\label{ex:test:1p1}

\noindent\emph{A test function}.

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

\bpycod
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
\epycod
\end{example}



\begin{example}
\label{ex:math:1p1}

\noindent\emph{Addition}.

We have

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]
\end{example}



\begin{tcolorbox}[%skin=widget,
boxrule=1mm,
coltitle=black,
colframe=blue!45!white,
colback=blue!15!white,
width=(.9\linewidth),before=\hfill,after=\hfill,
adjusted title={Highlight box!}]
This environment is used to highlight something:

\[ E = mc^2 \]
\end{tcolorbox}



\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, ``loose'' URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the \Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.~2 which is also often used.
Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen, or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of DocOnce features.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.
Percentage must be fixed: 7\%,  87.65\% and
50\% at the beginning of the line.

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \Verb!circle! function
above.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

% Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl's semi opinion 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. \longinlinecomment{mp 2}{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} and watch the video. It explains how files, like \Verb!myfile.py!, perhaps containing much math, like $\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines. }{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} } It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among \textcolor{red}{(hpl 3:)} \replace{laptops and mobile units}{computers, tablets, and phones}.

% Test horizontal rule

First\textcolor{red}{, (\textbf{edit 4}: add comma)} consider a quantity $Q$. \textcolor{red}{(edit 5:)} \replace{To this end,}{We note that}
$Q>0$, because (\textbf{edit 6}:) \remove{a} negative \textcolor{red}{(edit 7:)} \replace{quantity is}{quantities are} (\textbf{edit 8}:) \remove{just} negative.  \textcolor{red}{ (\textbf{edit 9}:) This comes as no surprise.}

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\Verb!verbatim inline! }

The point here is to test 1) \Verb!verbatim! code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


\begin{quote}
\emph{Fun is fun.}--- Unknown.
\end{quote}


And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \Verb!admon.do.txt!.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade \textsc{pdf}{\LaTeX} (from DocOnce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}

\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with paragraph heading.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with subsubsection heading.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote for testing \emph{emphasized words} and \textbf{boldface words},
also with hypens:
\emph{pre}-fix, post-\emph{fix}, \textbf{pre}-fix, post-\textbf{fix}.
\end{quote}


Here are two references. Equation~(\ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(\ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (\ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.


\subsection{Subsection 1}
\label{subsec1}

\index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}\marginpar{\footnotesize {\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.

\paragraph{Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence.}
Section~\ref{subsec1} is fine.
Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex} too.


% sphinx code--blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(\Verb!envir=ccq!):
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

Testing other code environments. First Python:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
which gets rendered as

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}
\noindent

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

\paragraph{Paragraph heading before code.}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
\end{minted}
\noindent

\paragraph{Subsubsection heading before code.}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def h(z):
    return z+1
\end{minted}
\noindent

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{minted}
\noindent

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\end{minted}
\noindent


Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}
\noindent

Standard Python shell sessions:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\end{minted}
\noindent

IPython sessions:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85]
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent


% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
\noindent
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
% It also tests emoji before code
And a little bit of Fortran: \raisebox{-\height+\ht\strutbox}{\includegraphics[height=1.5em]{latex_figs/dizzy_face.png}}

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
which then is typeset as

\providecommand{\shadedskip}{}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.87843, 0.95686, 1.0}

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
\Verb!<a href="! (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},
labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\end{Verbatim}

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
results in

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85]
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

% Here goes hidden code.
% Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.





Finally, \Verb?!bc do? supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85]
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! For
spellcheck, test \Verb!a verbatim expression! in \Verb!another! in a \Verb!third!.
Also test exclamation mark as in \Verb?!bc? and \Verb?!ec? as well as \Verb?a != b?.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}!.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red color} and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak\\
code.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when \Verb!html! \\
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},
labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
\end{Verbatim}


\paragraph{Footnotes.}
Here is a test of footnotes \footnote{Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format. Plain text does nothing, {\LaTeX} removes the definition and inserts the footnote as part of the {\LaTeX} text. reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.}, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

\begin{itemize}
 \item list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 \item even with math $\nabla^2u$\footnote{Math footnotes can be dangerous since it interferes with an exponent.}

 \item and code \Verb!h[i] += 1!\footnote{One--line footnote.}
   (\emph{must} have space between inline code and footnote!)

 \item and \href{{http://google.com}}{links}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}\footnote{\href{{google.com}}{\nolinkurl{google.com}\footnote{\texttt{google.com}}} is perhaps the most famous web site today.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third\footnote{Not much to add here, but the footnote is at the end with only one newline.} example.





Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Non--breaking space character.]
This paragraph aims to test \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non--breaking_space}}{non--breaking space character}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non--breaking\_space}}, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~\href{{http://google.com}}{link}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in \Verb![~x for x in y]! or in \Verb!y=~x!, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}\marginpar{\footnotesize figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
  \caption{
  Visualization of a wave. \label{fig:impact}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}



\index{movies}\marginpar{\footnotesize movies}


% Test multi--line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi--line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v2! as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{downloaded_figures/f_plot.png}}




% Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


\paragraph{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file \Verb!movies.do.txt!.


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin--end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}\marginpar{\footnotesize index with: subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}\marginpar{\footnotesize index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
2.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
4.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The DocOnce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{l}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
1.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
3.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!L\_i! } \\
\hline
0   & 0      & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1   & 11,000 & 216        & 0.0        \\
2   & 20,000 & 216        & 0.001      \\
3   & 32,000 & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4   & 47,000 & 270        & 0.0        \\
5   & 51,000 & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6   & 71,000 & 214        & \Verb!NaN! \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \Verb!|-! because of a negative number,
and \Verb!|! right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!v\_1! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \Verb!v\_2! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!verb\_3\_! } \\
\hline
9     & 9.62       & 5.57               & 8.98           \\
-20   & -23.39     & -7.65              & -19.93         \\
10    & 17.74      & -4.50              & 9.96           \\
0     & -9.19      & 4.13               & -0.26          \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $S$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ command } \\
\hline
$ ||a_0|| $ & \Verb!norm|length! \\
$x\cap y$   & \Verb!x|y!         \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

% Mako code to expand URLs in the table
% (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
 \\
\hline

\subsection{A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2! }

\paragraph{Paragraph with verbatim and math: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1.py! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2.py! define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is more \Verb!__verbatim__! code and
some plain text on a new line.

% Test various types of headlines
\subsection{\textbf{Just bold}}

Some text.

\subsection{\emph{Just emphasize}}

Some text.

\subsection{\protect\Verb!Just verbatim! }

Some text.


\paragraph{The middle has \emph{emphasize} word.}
Some text.


\paragraph{The middle has \protect\Verb!verbatim! word.}
Some text.


\paragraph{Ampersand.}
We can test Hennes {\&} Mauritz, often abbreviated H{\&}M, but written
as \Verb!Hennes & Mauritz! and \Verb!H & M!.
A sole \Verb!&! must also work.
% Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{Quotes.}
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double--quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX--style that gives correct {\LaTeX} formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non--LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like \Verb!.txt!.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier--Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{User--defined environments}



Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1} demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function \Verb!add! appears in
Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1}.



\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: A test function}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: A test function}

\label{ex:test:1p1}

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
\end{minted}
\noindent





\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Addition}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Addition}

\label{ex:math:1p1}

We have

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]




\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Highlight box!]
This environment is used to highlight something:

\[ E = mc^2 \]
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}





\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file}\footnote{\texttt{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}} is
fine to have. Moreover, ``loose'' URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi--colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes\_formulas}} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+\%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the \Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well--known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.~2 which is also often used.
Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen, or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of DocOnce features.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.
Percentage must be fixed: 7\%,  87.65\% and
50\% at the beginning of the line.


% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash--bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align--asterisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier--Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non--latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{minted}
\noindent

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \Verb!circle! function
above.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control}\footnote{\texttt{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox}\footnote{\texttt{http://dropbox.com}} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}\footnote{\texttt{http://drive.google.com}}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in--depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to--know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\Verb!verbatim inline! }

The point here is to test 1) \Verb!verbatim! code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


\begin{quote}
\emph{Fun is fun.}--- Unknown.
\end{quote}


And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \Verb!admon.do.txt!.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade \textsc{pdf}{\LaTeX} (from DocOnce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}

\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with paragraph heading.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with subsubsection heading.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote for testing \emph{emphasized words} and \textbf{boldface words},
also with hypens:
\emph{pre}-fix, post-\emph{fix}, \textbf{pre}-fix, post-\textbf{fix}.
\end{quote}


Here are two references. Equation~(\ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(\ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (\ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.


\subsection{Subsection 1}
\label{subsec1}

\index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}\marginpar{\footnotesize {\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.

\paragraph{Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence.}
Section~\ref{subsec1} is fine.
Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex} too.


% sphinx code--blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(\Verb!envir=ccq!):
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{Verbatim}

Testing other code environments. First Python:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
which gets rendered as

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

\paragraph{Paragraph heading before code.}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Subsubsection heading before code.}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def h(z):
    return z+1
\end{minted}

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{python:nt}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{python:nt}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{python:nt}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\end{python:nt}


Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}

Standard Python shell sessions:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\end{minted}

IPython sessions:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{ipy}
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\end{minted}


% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
% It also tests emoji before code
And a little bit of Fortran: \raisebox{-\height+\ht\strutbox}{\includegraphics[height=1.5em]{latex_figs/dizzy_face.png}}

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
which then is typeset as

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\end{Verbatim}

HTML:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{html}
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\end{minted}

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
\Verb!<a href="! (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=lines]
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\end{Verbatim}

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
\end{Verbatim}
results in

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{restructuredtext}
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
\end{minted}

% Here goes hidden code.
% Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.





Finally, \Verb?!bc do? supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{doconce}
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
\end{minted}

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! For
spellcheck, test \Verb!a verbatim expression! in \Verb!another! in a \Verb!third!.
Also test exclamation mark as in \Verb?!bc? and \Verb?!ec? as well as \Verb?a != b?.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}!.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red color} and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak\\
code.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when \Verb!html! \\
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=lines]
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
\end{Verbatim}


\paragraph{Footnotes.}
Here is a test of footnotes \footnote{Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format. Plain text does nothing, {\LaTeX} removes the definition and inserts the footnote as part of the {\LaTeX} text. reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.}, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

\begin{itemize}
 \item list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 \item even with math $\nabla^2u$\footnote{Math footnotes can be dangerous since it interferes with an exponent.}

 \item and code \Verb!h[i] += 1!\footnote{One--line footnote.}
   (\emph{must} have space between inline code and footnote!)

 \item and \href{{http://google.com}}{links}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}\footnote{\href{{google.com}}{\nolinkurl{google.com}\footnote{\texttt{google.com}}} is perhaps the most famous web site today.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third\footnote{Not much to add here, but the footnote is at the end with only one newline.} example.





Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Non--breaking space character.]
This paragraph aims to test \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non--breaking_space}}{non--breaking space character}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non--breaking\_space}}, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~\href{{http://google.com}}{link}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in \Verb![~x for x in y]! or in \Verb!y=~x!, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin--end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}\marginpar{\footnotesize test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}\marginpar{\footnotesize index with: subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}\marginpar{\footnotesize index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
2.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
4.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The DocOnce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

\end{Verbatim}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{l}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
1.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
3.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!L\_i! } \\
\hline
0   & 0      & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1   & 11,000 & 216        & 0.0        \\
2   & 20,000 & 216        & 0.001      \\
3   & 32,000 & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4   & 47,000 & 270        & 0.0        \\
5   & 51,000 & 270        & -0.0028    \\
6   & 71,000 & 214        & \Verb!NaN! \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with \Verb!|-! because of a negative number,
and \Verb!|! right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ exact } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!v\_1! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $a_i$ + \Verb!v\_2! } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!verb\_3\_! } \\
\hline
9     & 9.62       & 5.57               & 8.98           \\
-20   & -23.39     & -7.65              & -19.93         \\
10    & 17.74      & -4.50              & 9.96           \\
0     & -9.19      & 4.13               & -0.26          \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $S$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ command } \\
\hline
$ ||a_0|| $ & \Verb!norm|length! \\
$x\cap y$   & \Verb!x|y!         \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

% Mako code to expand URLs in the table
% (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}

\subsection{A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2! }

\paragraph{Paragraph with verbatim and math: \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v1.py! and \protect\Verb!my\_file\_v2.py! define some math $a_{i-1}$.}
Here is more \Verb!__verbatim__! code and

\paragraph{Ampersand.}
We can test Hennes {\&} Mauritz, often abbreviated H{\&}M, but written
as \Verb!Hennes & Mauritz! and \Verb!H & M!.
A sole \Verb!&! must also work.
% Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:

\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Quotes.}
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double--quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX--style that gives correct {\LaTeX} formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non--LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like \Verb!.txt!.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier--Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{User--defined environments}



Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1} demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function \Verb!add! appears in
Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1}.



\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: A test function}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: A test function}

\label{ex:test:1p1}

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
\end{minted}





\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Addition}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Addition}

\label{ex:math:1p1}

We have

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]




\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Highlight box!]
This environment is used to highlight something:

\[ E = mc^2 \]
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}





\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}\footnote{\texttt{testdoc.do.txt}}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}\footnote{\texttt{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file}\footnote{\texttt{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}} is
fine to have. Moreover, ``loose'' URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi--colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}\footnote{\texttt{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes}\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes\_formulas}} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}\footnote{\texttt{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+\%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the \Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}\footnote{\texttt{http://google.com}}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well--known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.~2 which is also often used.
Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen, or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of DocOnce features.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.
Percentage must be fixed: 7\%,  87.65\% and
50\% at the beginning of the line.


% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash--bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align--asterisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier--Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non--latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \Verb!random! module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}
\addcontentsline{loe}{doconceexercise}{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\begin{python:nt}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{python:nt}

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \Verb!circle! function
above.

\clearpage

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control}\footnote{\texttt{http://software--carpentry.org/2010/07/script--for-introduction-to--version-control/}} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox}\footnote{\texttt{http://dropbox.com}} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}\footnote{\texttt{http://drive.google.com}}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in--depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to--know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\subsection{Appendix: Testing inline comments}

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\Verb!verbatim inline! }

The point here is to test 1) \Verb!verbatim! code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


\begin{quote}
\emph{Fun is fun.}--- Unknown.
\end{quote}


And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \Verb!admon.do.txt!.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade \textsc{pdf}{\LaTeX} (from DocOnce).

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}

\section{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with paragraph heading.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with subsubsection heading.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote for testing \emph{emphasized words} and \textbf{boldface words},
also with hypens:
\emph{pre}-fix, post-\emph{fix}, \textbf{pre}-fix, post-\textbf{fix}.
\end{quote}


Here are two references. Equation~(\ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(\ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (\ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.


\subsection{Subsection 1}
\label{subsec1}

\index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.

\paragraph{Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence.}
Section~\ref{subsec1} is fine.
Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex} too.


% sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{cod}{cbg_gray}\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{Verbatim}
\end{cod}
\noindent
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{cod}{cbg_gray}\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{Verbatim}
\end{cod}
\noindent
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(\Verb!envir=ccq!):
\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

Testing other code environments. First Python:

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent
which gets rendered as

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

\paragraph{Paragraph heading before code.}

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

\paragraph{Subsubsection heading before code.}
\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
def h(z):
    return z+1
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\begin{pro}{cbg_blue1}{bar_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\end{lstlisting}\end{pro}
\noindent
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\begin{pro}{cbg_blue1}{bar_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\end{lstlisting}\end{pro}
\noindent


Then Cython:
\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

Standard Python shell sessions:

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

IPython sessions:

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent


% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\begin{pro}{cbg_blue1}{bar_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{lstlisting}\end{pro}
\noindent
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
% It also tests emoji before code
And a little bit of Fortran: \raisebox{-\height+\ht\strutbox}{\includegraphics[height=1.5em]{latex_figs/dizzy_face.png}}

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent
which then is typeset as

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

HTML:

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
\Verb!<a href="! (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\end{Verbatim}

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent
results in

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

% Here goes hidden code.
% Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.





Finally, \Verb?!bc do? supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! For
spellcheck, test \Verb!a verbatim expression! in \Verb!another! in a \Verb!third!.
Also test exclamation mark as in \Verb?!bc? and \Verb?!ec? as well as \Verb?a != b?.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}!.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red color} and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak\\
code.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when \Verb!html! \\
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
\end{Verbatim}


\paragraph{Footnotes.}
Here is a test of footnotes \footnote{Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format. Plain text does nothing, {\LaTeX} removes the definition and inserts the footnote as part of the {\LaTeX} text. reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.}, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

\begin{itemize}
 \item list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 \item even with math $\nabla^2u$\footnote{Math footnotes can be dangerous since it interferes with an exponent.}

 \item and code \Verb!h[i] += 1!\footnote{One-line footnote.}
   (\emph{must} have space between inline code and footnote!)

 \item and \href{{http://google.com}}{links}\footnote{\href{{google.com}}{\nolinkurl{google.com}} is perhaps the most famous web site today.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third\footnote{Not much to add here, but the footnote is at the end with only one newline.} example.





Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Non-breaking space character.]
This paragraph aims to test \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space}}{non-breaking space character}, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~\href{{http://google.com}}{link}~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in \Verb![~x for x in y]! or in \Verb!y=~x!, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Subsection 2: Testing figures}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
  \caption{
  Visualization of a wave. \label{fig:impact}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}



\index{movies}


% Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v2! as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{downloaded_figures/f_plot.png}}




% Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


\paragraph{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file \Verb!movies.do.txt!.


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\subsection{Tables}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated

\paragraph{Quotes.}
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct {\LaTeX} formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like \Verb!.txt!.


\subsection{Bibliography test}

Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection{User-defined environments}



Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1} demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function \Verb!add! appears in
Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1}.



\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: A test function}

\label{ex:test:1p1}

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

\begin{cod}{cbg_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
\end{lstlisting}\end{cod}
\noindent





\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Addition}

\label{ex:math:1p1}

We have

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]




\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Highlight box!]
This environment is used to highlight something:

\[ E = mc^2 \]
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}





\subsection{URLs}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, ``loose'' URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the \Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.~2 which is also often used.
Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen, or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of DocOnce features.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.
Percentage must be fixed: 7\%,  87.65\% and
50\% at the beginning of the line.


% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\section{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\begin{pro}{cbg_blue1}{bar_blue1}\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=redblue,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=3,numbersep=15pt,xleftmargin=1mm]
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{lstlisting}\end{pro}
\noindent

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

\clearpage

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

\subsection{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\Verb!verbatim inline! }

The point here is to test 1) \Verb!verbatim! code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


\begin{quote}
\emph{Fun is fun.}--- Unknown.
\end{quote}


And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \Verb!admon.do.txt!.

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2

  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line

**Here is a list with paragraph heading.**

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote for testing *emphasized words* and **boldface words**,
    also with hypens:
    *pre*-fix, post-*fix*, **pre**-fix, post-**fix**.



Here are two references. Equation |nbsp| (`my:eq1`_) is fine. Eq. |nbsp| (`my:eq1`_) too.

Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::

        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(``envir=ccq``)::

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

Testing other code environments. First Python::

        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::

        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()

Then Cython::

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1

Standard Python shell sessions::

        >>> from numpy import sin
        >>> # Some comment
        >>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions::

        In [1]: from numpy import sin
        
        In [2]: # Some comment
        
        In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++::

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

.. It also tests emoji before code

And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face::

        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end

HTML::

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
``<a href="`` (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call::

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.::

        !bc restructuredtext
        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.
        !ec

results in::

        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.

.. Here goes hidden code.

.. Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.

Finally, ``!bc do`` supports highlighting of DocOnce source::

        ======= DocOnce test file =======
        
        ===== Computer code =====
        
        Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
        code blocks:
        
        !bc pycod
        from math import sin
        
        def f(x):
            """Example on a function."""
            return sin(x) + 1
        
        print f(0)
        !ec
        
        
        ===== Mathematics =====
        
        Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
        as equations:
        
        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
        \end{align*}
        !et
        
        === Subsubsection heading ===
        
        DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
        
        __Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.

It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! For
spellcheck, test ``a verbatim expression`` in ``another`` in a ``third``.
Also test exclamation mark as in ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``a != b``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}``.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format rst.
Here is some **red color** and an attempt to write **with
green color containing a linebreak

| code.** Some formats will only display 
| this correctly when ``html`` 
| is the output format.

But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

Here is a test of footnotes [#footnote]_, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 * even with math \\( \nabla^2u \\) [#math1]_

 * and code ``h[i] += 1`` [#code]_
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)

 * and `links <http://google.com>`__ [#google-search]_

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third [#example-of-the-third-footnote]_ example.

.. [#footnote] Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
   Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
   definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
   reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
   as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
   syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.

.. [#math1] Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
   interferes with an exponent.

.. [#code] One-line footnote.

.. [#google-search] `<google.com>`_ is perhaps the most famous
   web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


.. admonition:: Non-breaking space character

   This paragraph aims to test `non-breaking space character <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space>`__, and a typical
   example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 |nbsp| km is traveled
   in |nbsp| \\( 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345 \\) |nbsp| s.  Also check that a |nbsp| `link <http://google.com>`__ |nbsp| is
   not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
   (On the other hand, the tilde is used in
   computer code, e.g., as in ``[~x for x in y]`` or in ``y=~x``, and should
   of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)

Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure `fig:impact`_ in which
there is a flow.

.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of a wave*  (fig:impact)

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

.. Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure `myfig`_ with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 500

   *A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$*  (myfig)

.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:

.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500

.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs

**Remark.**
Movies are tested in separate file ``movies.do.txt``.

.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

.. _decay:sec:theta:

The \\( \theta \\) parameter (not \\( \nabla \\)?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \\( \theta \\)::

        def f(theta):
            return theta**2

**More on \\( \theta \\).**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\\( \frac{1}{2} \\), \\( {1/2} \\), \\( \pmb{x} \\), \\( \frac{Du}{dt} \\),
both inline and in block

.. raw:: html

        $$
        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}
        $$

Or with align with label and numbers

.. raw:: html

        $$
        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}
        $$

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

.. begin theorem

**Theorem 5.**
Let \\( a=1 \\) and \\( b=2 \\). Then \\( c=3 \\).

.. end theorem

.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since \\( c=a+b \\), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\\( \Diamond \\)

.. end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------

.. index with comma could fool sphinx

Let us take this table from the manual:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The DocOnce source code reads::

        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     
====  ========  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

=========  ===========  ================  =======  
\\( i \\)  \\( h_i \\)  \\( \bar T_i \\)  ``L_i``  
=========  ===========  ================  =======  
0                    0               288  -0.0065  
1               11,000               216      0.0  
2               20,000               216    0.001  
3               32,000               228   0.0028  
4               47,000               270      0.0  
5               51,000               270  -0.0028  
6               71,000               214  ``NaN``  
=========  ===========  ================  =======  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====  =======  =====================  ===========  
exact  ``v_1``  \\( a_i \\) + ``v_2``  ``verb_3_``  
=====  =======  =====================  ===========  
    9     9.62                   5.57         8.98  
  -20   -23.39                  -7.65       -19.93  
   10    17.74                  -4.50         9.96  
    0    -9.19                   4.13        -0.26  
=====  =======  =====================  ===========  

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

===============  ===============  
   \\( S \\)         command      
===============  ===============  
$ ||a_0|| $      ``norm|length``  
\\( x\cap y \\)          ``x|y``  
===============  ===============  

Finally, a table with math
(``bm`` that expands to ``boldsymbol``, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

.. Mako code to expand URLs in the table

.. (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)

**Paragraph with verbatim and math: ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math \\( a_{i-1} \\).**
Here is more ``__verbatim__`` code and
some plain text on a new line.

.. Test various types of headlines

**Just bold**

**``Verbatim beginning``.**
Some text.

**Maybe *emphasize end*.**
Some text.

**Maybe ``verbatim end``.**
Some text.

**The middle has *emphasize* word.**
Some text.

**The middle has ``verbatim`` word.**
Some text.

**Ampersand.**
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as ``Hennes & Mauritz`` and ``H & M``.
A sole ``&`` must also work.

.. Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text::

        # Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
        c = a & b

**Quotes.**
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like ``.txt``.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

User-defined environments
-------------------------

The example in the section `Example 1: A test function`_ demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function ``add`` appears in
the example in the section `Example 1: A test function`_.

.. _ex:test:1p1:

Example 1: A test function
--------------------------

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition::

        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def test_add():
            a = 1; b = 1
            expected = a + b
            computed = add(a, b)
            assert expected == computed

.. _ex:math:1p1:

We have

.. raw:: html

        $$ 1 + 1 = 2 $$


.. admonition:: Highlight box

   This environment is used to highlight something
   
   .. raw:: html
   
           $$ E = mc^2 $$




.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`__. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`__ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`__, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`__, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`__ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`__. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the ``--latex_no_program_footnotelink``
is used), as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`__, `ball1.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>`__,
and `ball2.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>`__.

.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`__, `google <http://google.com>`__, and
`google <http://google.com>`__, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

.. !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------

.. keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

.. Torture tests

**a)**
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin \\( N \\) times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 1.**
Use ``r = random.random()`` and define head as ``r <= 0.5``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
Draw an integer among \\( \{1,2\} \\) with
``r = random.randint(1,2)`` and define head when ``r`` is 1.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin answer of exercise ---

**Answer.**
If the ``random.random()`` function returns a number \\( <1/2 \\), let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this \\( N \\) number of times.

.. --- end answer of exercise ---

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**::

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \\( [0,1) \\)?

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

1. item1

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \\( N \\) such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, \\( M \\), that fall in the interval \\( (0.5,0.6) \\), and
compute the probability as \\( M/N \\).

Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by

.. raw:: html

        $$
        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}
        $$

where \\( R \\) is the radius of the circle, \\( (x_0,y_0) \\) is the
center point, and \\( t \\) is a parameter in the unit interval \\( [0,1] \\).
For any \\( t \\), \\( (x,y) \\) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle::

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)

.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw \\( N \\) circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.

**a)**
Let \\( R \\) be normally distributed and \\( (x_0,y_0) \\) uniformly distributed.

Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation
---------------------------------------------



.. begin quiz

Given

.. raw:: html

        $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 $$

What is the solution of this equation?


**Choice A:** \\( y=e^{-y} \\) :abbr:`? (Right!)`

**Choice B:** \\( y=e^{y} \\) :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (Almost, but the sign is wrong (note the minus!).)`

**Choice C:** Code::

        from math import exp
        def f(x):
            return exp(x) :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (Ooops, forgot a minus: exp(-x), otherwise this Python code must be considered as a good answer. It is more natural, though, to write the solution to the problem in mathematical notation  .. raw:: html          $$ y(x) = e^{-y}.$$)`

**Choice D:** The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation. :abbr:`? (Wrong!)` :abbr:`# (Equations with derivatives can be solved; they are termed *differential equations*.)`

**Choice E:** The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\), not a function \\( y(x) \\). :abbr:`? (Wrong!)`

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.




Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`__ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`__ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`__.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. **(**hpl's semi opinion 1**: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.**) I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. **(**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains
how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like
\\( \partial u/\partial t \\), are easily communicated between machines.**) It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among **(**hpl 3**: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones**).

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


..

    *Fun is fun.*--- Unknown.



And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: ``admon.do.txt``.

   is at the end with only one newline.

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2

  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line

**Here is a list with paragraph heading.**

  * item2

Here is a list with subsubsection heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * item1

  * item2


..

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote for testing *emphasized words* and **boldface words**,
    also with hypens:
    *pre*-fix, post-*fix*, **pre**-fix, post-**fix**.



Here are two references. Equation |nbsp| :eq:`my:eq1` is fine. Eq. |nbsp| :eq:`my:eq1` too.
Even Equation :eq:`my:eq1` without the tilde.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

.. _subsec1:

.. index:: somefunc function

.. Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line

.. and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
the section :ref:`sec1` and :ref:`subsec1`, and further to the
the sections :ref:`subsec1` and :ref:`subsubsec:ex`, which
encourages you to do the tasks in :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`exer:some:formula`.
Appendices     :ref:`app1` and :ref:`app2` are also nice elements.

The section :ref:`subsec1` is fine.
The section :ref:`subsubsec:ex` too.

.. sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(``envir=ccq``):

.. code-block:: text

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as

.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

**Paragraph heading before code.**

.. code-block:: python

        import sys
        sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)

Subsubsection heading before code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

        def h(z):
            return z+1

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

.. raw:: html

        <iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"
                src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&curInstr=0&py=2&cumulative=false">
        </iframe>

Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:

.. sagecellserver::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()

Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1

Standard Python shell sessions:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> from numpy import sin
        >>> # Some comment
        >>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions:

.. code-block:: ipy

        In [1]: from numpy import sin
        
        In [2]: # Some comment
        
        In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

.. It also tests emoji before code

And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:

.. code-block:: text

        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end

HTML:

.. code-block:: html

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
``<a href="`` (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

.. code-block:: text

        !bc restructuredtext
        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.
        !ec

results in

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.

.. Here goes hidden code.

.. Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.

Finally, ``!bc do`` supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

.. code-block:: doconce

        ======= DocOnce test file =======
        
        ===== Computer code =====
        
        Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
        code blocks:
        
        !bc pycod
        from math import sin
        
        def f(x):
            """Example on a function."""
            return sin(x) + 1
        
        print f(0)
        !ec
        
        
        ===== Mathematics =====
        
        Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0$, or typeset
        as equations:
        
        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \boldsymbol{u} &= \nabla\phi .
        \end{align*}
        !et
        
        === Subsubsection heading ===
        
        DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
        
        __Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.

It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! For
spellcheck, test ``a verbatim expression`` in ``another`` in a ``third``.
Also test exclamation mark as in ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``a != b``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}``.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format sphinx.
Here is some **red color** and an attempt to write **with
green color containing a linebreak

| code.** Some formats will only display 
| this correctly when ``html`` 
| is the output format.

But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

Here is a test of footnotes [#footnote]_, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 * even with math :math:`\nabla^2u` [#math1]_

 * and code ``h[i] += 1`` [#code]_
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)

 * and `links <http://google.com>`__ [#google-search]_

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third [#example-of-the-third-footnote]_ example.

.. [#footnote] Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
   Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
   definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
   reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
   as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
   syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.

.. [#math1] Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
   interferes with an exponent.

.. [#code] One-line footnote.

.. [#google-search] `<google.com>`_ is perhaps the most famous
   web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


.. admonition:: Non-breaking space character

   This paragraph aims to test `non-breaking space character <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space>`__, and a typical
   example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 |nbsp| km is traveled
   in |nbsp| :math:`7.4/5.5\approx 1.345` |nbsp| s.  Also check that a |nbsp| `link <http://google.com>`__ |nbsp| is
   not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
   (On the other hand, the tilde is used in
   computer code, e.g., as in ``[~x for x in y]`` or in ``y=~x``, and should
   of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)




.. _subsec:ex:

Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

.. index:: figures

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.

.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of a wave*

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

.. index:: movies

.. Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 500

   A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in :math:`t_{i+1}`

.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:

.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500

Test SVG figure:

.. figure:: http://openclipart.org/people/jpneok/junebug.svg
   :width: 200

.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs

**Remark.**
Movies are tested in separate file ``movies.do.txt``.

.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: text

        def f(theta):
            return theta**2

**More on :math:`\theta`.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
:math:`\frac{1}{2}`, :math:`{1/2}`, :math:`\pmb{x}`, :math:`\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:

.. math::
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        

Or with align with label and numbers:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq1
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} = 0
        
        

.. math::
          
        \frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
        

.. math::
   :label: aligneq2
          
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
        
        

Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

.. begin theorem

**Theorem 5.**
Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.

.. end theorem

.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`

.. end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------

.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible

.. index:: test two (separate) verbatim expressions which is also possible

.. index::
   single: index with; subindex

.. index with comma could fool sphinx

.. index::
   single: index, with comma, and one more

Let us take this table from the manual:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The DocOnce source code reads

.. code-block:: text

          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     
====  ========  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

=========  ===========  ================  =======  
:math:`i`  :math:`h_i`  :math:`\bar T_i`  ``L_i``  
=========  ===========  ================  =======  
0                    0               288  -0.0065  
1               11,000               216      0.0  
2               20,000               216    0.001  
3               32,000               228   0.0028  
4               47,000               270      0.0  
5               51,000               270  -0.0028  
6               71,000               214  ``NaN``  
=========  ===========  ================  =======  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====  =======  =====================  ===========  
exact  ``v_1``  :math:`a_i` + ``v_2``  ``verb_3_``  
=====  =======  =====================  ===========  
    9     9.62                   5.57         8.98  
  -20   -23.39                  -7.65       -19.93  
   10    17.74                  -4.50         9.96  
    0    -9.19                   4.13        -0.26  
=====  =======  =====================  ===========  

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

===============  ===============  
   :math:`S`         command      
===============  ===============  
$ ||a_0|| $      ``norm|length``  
:math:`x\cap y`          ``x|y``  
===============  ===============  

Finally, a table with math
(``bm`` that expands to ``boldsymbol``, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

.. Mako code to expand URLs in the table

.. (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript :math:`a_i`: ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Paragraph with verbatim and math: ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math :math:`a_{i-1}`.**
Here is more ``__verbatim__`` code and
some plain text on a new line.

.. Test various types of headlines

**Just bold**
-------------

Some text.

*Just emphasize*
----------------

Some text.

``Just verbatim``
-----------------

Some text.

**Bold** beginning
------------------

Some text.

*Emphasize* beginning
---------------------

Some text.

``Verbatim`` beginning
----------------------

Some text.

Maybe **bold end**
------------------

Some text.

Maybe *emphasize end*
---------------------

Some text.

Maybe ``verbatim end``
----------------------

Some text.

The middle has **bold** word
----------------------------

Some text.

The middle has *emphasize* word
-------------------------------

Some text.

The middle has ``verbatim`` word
--------------------------------

Some text.

***Just emphasize*.**
Some text.

**``Just verbatim``.**
Some text.

***Emphasize* beginning.**
Some text.

**``Verbatim beginning``.**
Some text.

**Maybe *emphasize end*.**
Some text.

**Maybe ``verbatim end``.**
Some text.

**The middle has *emphasize* word.**
Some text.

**The middle has ``verbatim`` word.**
Some text.

**Ampersand.**
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as ``Hennes & Mauritz`` and ``H & M``.
A sole ``&`` must also work.

.. Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

.. code-block:: text

        # Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
        c = a & b

**Quotes.**
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like ``.txt``.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

User-defined environments
-------------------------

The example in the section :ref:`ex:test:1p1` demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function ``add`` appears in
the example in the section :ref:`ex:test:1p1`.

.. _ex:test:1p1:

Example 1: A test function
--------------------------

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

.. code-block:: python

        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def test_add():
            a = 1; b = 1
            expected = a + b
            computed = add(a, b)
            assert expected == computed

.. _ex:math:1p1:

Example 2: Addition
-------------------

We have

.. math::
         1 + 1 = 2 


.. admonition:: Highlight box

   This environment is used to highlight something:
   
   .. math::
            E = mc^2




.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`__. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`__ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`__, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`__, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`__ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`__. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the ``--latex_no_program_footnotelink``
is used), as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`__, `ball1.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>`__,
and `ball2.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>`__.

.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`__, `google <http://google.com>`__, and
`google <http://google.com>`__, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

.. !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

.. !split

LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`, using the equation environment:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:

.. math::
        
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        

And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. math::
   :label: eq1
        
        a = q + 4 + 5+ 6  
        

.. math::
   :label: eq2
          
        b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to :eq:`eq1`-:eq:`eq2`. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in ``CG-2``.
Also test :math:`a_{i-j}` as well as :math:`kx-wt`.

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`demo:ex:2`,
as well as :ref:`proj:circle1` and :ref:`exer:you`, and in
between there we have :ref:`exer:some:formula`.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
Draw an integer among :math:`\{1,2\}` with
``r = random.randint(1,2)`` and define head when ``r`` is 1.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin answer of exercise ---

**Answer.**
If the ``random.random()`` function returns a number :math:`<1/2`, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this :math:`N` number of times.

.. --- end answer of exercise ---

.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

**Solution.**

.. code-block:: python

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

.. --- end solution of exercise ---

**b)**
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

**c)**
Vectorize the code in a) using ``numpy.sum``.

.. --- begin answer of exercise ---

**Answer.**
``np.sum(np.where(r <= 0.5, 1, 0))`` or ``np.sum(r <= 0.5)``.

Project 4: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval :math:`[0,1)`?

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw :math:`N` such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, :math:`M`, that fall in the interval :math:`(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as :math:`M/N`.

Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by

.. math::
        
        x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
        

.. math::
          
        y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        

where :math:`R` is the radius of the circle, :math:`(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and :math:`t` is a parameter in the unit interval :math:`[0,1]`.
For any :math:`t`, :math:`(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)

.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw :math:`N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.




Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent `Script for Introduction to Version Control <http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>`__ provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`__ and `Google Drive <http://drive.google.com>`__.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

.. Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [**hpl's semi opinion 1**: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [**mp 2**: Simply go to `<http://dropbox.com>`_ and watch the video. It explains how files, like ``myfile.py``, perhaps containing much math, like :math:`\partial u/\partial t`, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among (**hpl 3: remove** laptops and mobile units) (**insert:**)computers, tablets, and phones (**end insert**).

First, (**edit 4: add comma**) consider a quantity :math:`Q`. (**edit 5: remove** To this end,) (**insert:**)We note that (**end insert**)

Appendix: Testing headings ending with ``verbatim inline``
----------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) ``verbatim`` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: ``admon.do.txt``.

def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
}}}
which gets rendered as

{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

*Paragraph heading before code.*

{{{
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
}}}

==== Subsubsection heading before code ====

{{{
def h(z):
    return z+1
}}}

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

{{{
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
}}}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

{{{
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
}}}


Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

Standard Python shell sessions:

{{{
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
}}}

IPython sessions:

{{{
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
}}}


<wiki:comment> This one tests a + sign before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
<wiki:comment> The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> It also tests emoji before code </wiki:comment>
And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:

{{{
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
}}}
which then is typeset as

{{{
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
}}}

HTML:

{{{
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
}}}

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
`<a href="` (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

{{{
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
}}}
results in

{{{
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
}}}

<wiki:comment> Here goes hidden code. </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out. </wiki:comment>





Finally, `!bc do` supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

{{{
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
}}}

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! For
spellcheck, test `a verbatim expression` in `another` in a `third`.
Also test exclamation mark as in `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `a != b`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}`.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format gwiki.
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak

code.</font> Some formats will only display 

this correctly when `html` 

is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

==== Running OS commands ====

{{{
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
}}}


==== Footnotes ====

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in


 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 * even with math `\nabla^2u`[^math1]
 * and code `h[i] += 1`[^code]   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)
 * and [http://google.com links][^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: google.com is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

*Non-breaking space character.* 
This paragraph aims to test [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space non-breaking space character], and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 km is traveled
in `7.4/5.5\approx 1.345` s.  Also check that a~[http://google.com link]~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in `[~x for x in y]` or in `y=~x`, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)



==== Subsection 2: Testing figures ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  Visualization of a wave. (fig:impact)

(the URL of the image file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------



Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure: 

(the URL of the image file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------





<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in `t_{i+1}`. (myfig) 

(the URL of the image file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------



<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>

Test URL as figure name:



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure: 

(the URL of the image file https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png must be inserted here)

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------




<wiki:comment> Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs </wiki:comment>


*Remark.*
Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

==== The `\theta` parameter (not `\nabla`?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving `\theta`:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

*More on `\theta`.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
`\frac{1}{2}`, `{1/2}`, `\pmb{x}`, `\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:

{{{
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
}}}

Or with align with label and numbers:

{{{
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
}}}


==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



*Theorem 5.*
Let `a=1` and `b=2`. Then `c=3`.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
*Proof.*
Since `c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
`END`
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


==== Tables ====

<wiki:comment> index with comma could fool sphinx </wiki:comment>

Let us take this table from the manual:



 ||  _time_   ||  _velocity_   ||  _acceleration_   ||
 ||  0.0      ||  1.4186       ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0      ||  1.376512     ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0      ||  1.1E+1       ||  14.717624        ||



The DocOnce source code reads
{{{

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 ||  _time_   ||  _velocity_   ||  _acceleration_   ||
 ||  0.0      ||  1.4186       ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  1.0      ||  1.376512     ||  11.919           ||
 ||  3.0      ||  1.1E+1       ||  14.717624        ||


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


 ||  _`i`_   ||  _`h_i`_    ||  _`\bar T_i`_   ||   _`L_i`_    ||
 ||  0       ||  0          ||  288            ||  -0.0065     ||
 ||  1       ||  11,000     ||  216            ||  0.0         ||
 ||  2       ||  20,000     ||  216            ||  0.001       ||
 ||  3       ||  32,000     ||  228            ||  0.0028      ||
 ||  4       ||  47,000     ||  270            ||  0.0         ||
 ||  5       ||  51,000     ||  270            ||  -0.0028     ||
 ||  6       ||  71,000     ||  214            ||  `NaN`       ||


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


 ||  _exact_   ||  _`v_1`_    ||  _`a_i` + `v_2`_   ||  _`verb_3_`_   ||
 ||  9         ||  9.62       ||  5.57              ||  8.98          ||
 ||  -20       ||  -23.39     ||  -7.65             ||  -19.93        ||
 ||  10        ||  17.74      ||  -4.50             ||  9.96          ||
 ||  0         ||  -9.19      ||  4.13              ||  -0.26         ||


Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:


 ||      _`S`_       ||     _command_      ||
 ||  $ ||a_0|| $     ||  `norm|length`     ||
 ||  `x\cap y`       ||  `x|y`             ||


Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

==== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript `a_i`: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` ====

*Paragraph with verbatim and math: `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math `a_{i-1}`.* Here is more `__verbatim__` code and
some plain text on a new line.

<wiki:comment> Test various types of headlines </wiki:comment>
==== *Just bold* ====

Some text.

==== *Just emphasize* ====

Some text.

==== `Just verbatim` ====

Some text.

==== *Bold* beginning ====

Some text.

==== *Emphasize* beginning ====

Some text.

==== `Verbatim` beginning ====

Some text.

==== Maybe *bold end* ====

Some text.

==== Maybe *emphasize end* ====

Some text.

==== Maybe `verbatim end` ====

Some text.

==== The middle has *bold* word ====

Some text.

==== The middle has *emphasize* word ====

Some text.

==== The middle has `verbatim` word ====

Some text.


**Just emphasize*.* Some text.


*`Just verbatim`.* Some text.


**Emphasize* beginning.* Some text.


*`Verbatim beginning`.* Some text.


*Maybe *emphasize end*.* Some text.


*Maybe `verbatim end`.* Some text.


*The middle has *emphasize* word.* Some text.


*The middle has `verbatim` word.* Some text.


*Ampersand.*
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as `Hennes & Mauritz` and `H & M`.
A sole `&` must also work.
<wiki:comment> Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text. </wiki:comment>

{{{
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
}}}

*Quotes.*
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like `.txt`.


==== Bibliography test ====

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.




<wiki:comment> --- begin exercise --- </wiki:comment>

==== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ====

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)*
State some problem.

*Solution.*
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)*
State some other problem.

*Hint 1.*
A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.*
Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.*
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<wiki:comment> --- end exercise --- </wiki:comment>


==== User-defined environments ====

The example in the section [#Example_1:_A_test_function] demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function `add` appears in
the example in the section [#Example_1:_A_test_function].



==== Example 1: A test function ====

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

{{{
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
}}}





==== Example 2: Addition ====

We have

{{{
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]
}}}



*Highlight box!* 
This environment is used to highlight something:

{{{
\[ E = mc^2 \]
}}}





==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl], or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link with
newline]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. Also `file:///` works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html link to a
file] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [mailto:hpl@simula.no `hpl@simula.no`], or just a [mailto:hpl@simula.no mail link], or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas Newton-Cotes] formulas
and a [http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1 good book]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py `decay_mod`], [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py `ball1.py`],
and [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py `ball2.py`].


<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> format extra blanks make a paragraph break). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. </wiki:comment>

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
[http://google.com google], [http://google.com google], and
[http://google.com google], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<wiki:comment> !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment </wiki:comment>

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
{{{
\[ a = b + c \]
}}}
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
{{{
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
{{{
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
}}}



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Project_4:_Compute_a_Probability],
as well as [#Project_5:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_11:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_gwiki], and in
between there we have [#Exercise_10:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].

==== Project 4: Compute a Probability ====

<wiki:comment> Minimalistic exercise </wiki:comment>


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval `[0,1)`?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:


# item1
# item2

<wiki:comment> --- begin hint in exercise --- </wiki:comment>

*Hint.*
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw `N` such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, `M`, that fall in the interval `(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as `M/N`.

==== Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by

{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where `R` is the radius of the circle, `(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and `t` is a parameter in the unit interval `[0,1]`.
For any `t`, `(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> which we normally want to keep where they are. </wiki:comment>

The goal of this project is to draw `N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.

What is the solution of this equation?

Choice A: `y=e^{-y}`

Choice B: `y=e^{y}`

Choice C: 
{{{
from math import exp
def f(x):
    return exp(x)
}}}

Choice D: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/ Script for Introduction to Version Control] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [http://dropbox.com Dropbox] and [http://drive.google.com Google Drive].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

==== Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline` ====

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:





And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

==== Computer code ====

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</syntaxhighlight>
and then just the subroutine,
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
</syntaxhighlight>
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(<code>envir=ccq</code>):
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</syntaxhighlight>

Testing other code environments. First Python:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
which gets rendered as

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def f(x):
    return x+1
</syntaxhighlight>

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

''Paragraph heading before code.''

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Subsubsection heading before code ====

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def h(z):
    return z+1
</syntaxhighlight>

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):

        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
</syntaxhighlight>

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
</syntaxhighlight>


Then Cython:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
</syntaxhighlight>

Standard Python shell sessions:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
which then is typeset as

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
</syntaxhighlight>

HTML:

<syntaxhighlight lang="html5">
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
</syntaxhighlight>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
<code><a href="</code> (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
</syntaxhighlight>

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
</syntaxhighlight>
results in

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- Here goes hidden code. -->
<!-- Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out. -->





Finally, <code>!bc do</code> supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
</syntaxhighlight>

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! For
spellcheck, test <code>a verbatim expression</code> in <code>another</code> in a <code>third</code>.
Also test exclamation mark as in <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>a != b</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code>.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format mwiki.
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak<br />
code.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when <code>html</code> <br />
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

==== Running OS commands ====

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
</syntaxhighlight>


==== Footnotes ====

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in


<ul>
 <li> list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 <li> even with math <math>\nabla^2u</math>[^math1]
 <li> and code <code>h[i] += 1</code>[^code]
   (''must'' have space between inline code and footnote!)
 <li> and [http://google.com links][^google-search]
</ul>

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: google.com is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Non-breaking space character.''' This paragraph aims to test [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space non-breaking space character], and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4&nbsp;km is traveled
in&nbsp;<math>7.4/5.5\approx 1.345</math>&nbsp;s.  Also check that a~[http://google.com link]~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in <code>[~x for x in y]</code> or in <code>y=~x</code>, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
}}



==== Subsection 2: Testing figures ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.


[[File:Wave1D.png|frame|200px|alt=Wave1D.png|Visualization of a wave. (fig:impact)]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.


[[File:Wave1D.png|frame|200px|alt=Wave1D.png|<span title=""></span>]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->




<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


[[File:Wave1D.png|frame|500px|alt=Wave1D.png|A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in <math>t_{i+1}</math>. (myfig)]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->


<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

Test URL as figure name:


[[File:f_plot.png|frame|500,px|link=https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog|alt=f_plot.png|<span title=""></span>]]



<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

    [[File:Df plot.png|frame|800px|alt=Df plot.png|This is a wikimedia figure file.]] <!-- user: Hplwp, filename: df_plot.png, timestamp: 2013-01-10T11:37:05Z -->


<!-- Non-uploaded file with no caption -->

[[File:Df2s8765s plot.png|frame|200,px|alt=Df2s8765s plot.png|<span title=""></span>]] <!-- not yet uploaded to common.wikimedia.org -->



''Remark.''
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.


<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

==== The <math>\theta</math> parameter (not <math>\nabla</math>?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving <math>\theta</math>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</syntaxhighlight>

''More on <math>\theta</math>.''
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
<math>\frac{1}{2}</math>, <math>{1/2}</math>, <math>\pmb{x}</math>, <math>\frac{Du}{dt}</math>,
both inline and in block:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

Or with align with label and numbers:

:<math>
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align}
</math>

The labels above are removed in mwiki since mwiki cannot refer to
labels in equations.

==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<!-- begin theorem -->



''Theorem 5.''
Let <math>a=1</math> and <math>b=2</math>. Then <math>c=3</math>.
<!-- end theorem -->

<!-- begin proof -->
''Proof.''
Since <math>c=a+b</math>, the result follows from straightforward addition.
<math>\Diamond</math>
<!-- end proof -->

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


==== Tables ====

<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

Let us take this table from the manual:


<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">time</th> <th align="center">velocity</th> <th align="center">acceleration</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0     </td> <td align="right">   1.4186      </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0     </td> <td align="right">   1.376512    </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4.0     </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1      </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The DocOnce source code reads
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

</syntaxhighlight>

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="left">time</th> <th align="left">velocity</th> <th align="left">acceleration</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0     </td> <td align="left">   1.4186      </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1.0     </td> <td align="left">   1.376512    </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3.0     </td> <td align="left">   1.1E+1      </td> <td align="left">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center"><math>i</math></th> <th align="center"><math>h_i</math></th> <th align="center"><math>\bar T_i</math></th> <td align="center"><code>L_i</code></td> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0                 </td> <td align="right">   0                   </td> <td align="right">   288                      </td> <td align="right">   -0.0065             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   1                 </td> <td align="right">   11,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2                 </td> <td align="right">   20,000              </td> <td align="right">   216                      </td> <td align="right">   0.001               </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   3                 </td> <td align="right">   32,000              </td> <td align="right">   228                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0028              </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   4                 </td> <td align="right">   47,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                      </td> <td align="right">   0.0                 </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   5                 </td> <td align="right">   51,000              </td> <td align="right">   270                      </td> <td align="right">   -0.0028             </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   6                 </td> <td align="right">   71,000              </td> <td align="right">   214                      </td> <td align="right">   <code>NaN</code>    </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">exact</th> <td align="center"><code>v_1</code></td> <td align="center"><math>a_i</math> + <code>v_2</code></td> <td align="center"><code>verb_3_</code></td> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="right">   9        </td> <td align="right">   9.62                </td> <td align="right">   5.57                                   </td> <td align="right">   8.98                    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   -20      </td> <td align="right">   -23.39              </td> <td align="right">   -7.65                                  </td> <td align="right">   -19.93                  </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   10       </td> <td align="right">   17.74               </td> <td align="right">   -4.50                                  </td> <td align="right">   9.96                    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   0        </td> <td align="right">   -9.19               </td> <td align="right">   4.13                                   </td> <td align="right">   -0.26                   </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">   <math>S</math>   </th> <th align="center">        command         </th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   $ ||a_0|| $             </td> <td align="right">   <code>norm|length</code>    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   <math>x\cap y</math>    </td> <td align="right">   <code>x|y</code>            </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->


<table border="1">
<tr></tr>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="center">   <math>\mathcal{L}=0</math>            </td> <td align="center">   [../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0080.png <code>080</code>]    </td> <td align="center">   [../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0085.png <code>085</code>]    </td> </tr>

</tbody>
</table>

==== A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript <math>a_i</math>: <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> ====

''Paragraph with verbatim and math: <code>my_file_v1.py</code> and <code>my_file_v2.py</code> define some math <math>a_{i-1}</math>.''
Here is more <code>__verbatim__</code> code and
some plain text on a new line.

<!-- Test various types of headlines -->
==== '''Just bold''' ====

Some text.

==== ''Just emphasize'' ====

Some text.

==== <code>Just verbatim</code> ====

Some text.

==== '''Bold''' beginning ====

Some text.

==== ''Emphasize'' beginning ====

Some text.

==== <code>Verbatim</code> beginning ====

Some text.

==== Maybe '''bold end''' ====

Some text.

==== Maybe ''emphasize end'' ====

Some text.

==== Maybe <code>verbatim end</code> ====

Some text.

==== The middle has '''bold''' word ====

Some text.

==== The middle has ''emphasize'' word ====

Some text.

==== The middle has <code>verbatim</code> word ====

Some text.


''''Just emphasize''.''
Some text.


''<code>Just verbatim</code>.''
Some text.


''''Emphasize'' beginning.''
Some text.


''<code>Verbatim beginning</code>.''
Some text.


''Maybe ''emphasize end''.''
Some text.


''Maybe <code>verbatim end</code>.''
Some text.


''The middle has ''emphasize'' word.''
Some text.


''The middle has <code>verbatim</code> word.''
Some text.


''Ampersand.''
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as <code>Hennes & Mauritz</code> and <code>H & M</code>.
A sole <code>&</code> must also work.
<!-- Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text. -->

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
</syntaxhighlight>

''Quotes.''
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like <code>.txt</code>.


==== Bibliography test ====

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ====

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


''a)''
State some problem.

''Solution.''
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

''b)''
State some other problem.

''Hint 1.''
A hint can be given.

''Hint 2.''
Maybe even another hint?

''Solution.''
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


==== User-defined environments ====

The example in the section [#Example_1:_A_test_function] demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function <code>add</code> appears in
the example in the section [#Example_1:_A_test_function].



==== Example 1: A test function ====

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
</syntaxhighlight>





==== Example 2: Addition ====

We have

:<math>
 1 + 1 = 2 
</math>




{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Highlight box!''' This environment is used to highlight something:

:<math>
 E = mc^2 
</math>
}}





==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl], or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link with
newline]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. Also <code>file:///</code> works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html link to a
file] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [mailto:hpl@simula.no <code>hpl@simula.no</code>], or just a [mailto:hpl@simula.no mail link], or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas Newton-Cotes] formulas
and a [http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1 good book]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py <code>decay_mod</code>], [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py <code>ball1.py</code>],
and [http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py <code>ball2.py</code>].


<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
[http://google.com google], [http://google.com google], and
[http://google.com google], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
:<math>
 a = b + c 
</math>
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
:<math>
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u </math>
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:

as well as [#Project_5:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_11:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_mwiki], and in
between there we have [#Exercise_10:_Make_references_to_projects_and_problems].


== Exercises ==



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Problem 2: Flip a Coin ====

<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<!-- Torture tests -->


''a)''
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin <math>N</math> times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint 1.''
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r <= 0.5</code>.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint 2.''
Draw an integer among <math>\{1,2\}</math> with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number <math><1/2</math>, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this <math>N</math> number of times.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
''Solution.''
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

''b)''
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

''c)''
Vectorize the code in a) using <code>numpy.sum</code>.


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
<code>np.sum(np.where(r <= 0.5, 1, 0))</code> or <code>np.sum(r <= 0.5)</code>.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->

In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.


==== My remarks ====

Remarks with such a subsubsection is treated as more text
after the last subexercise. Test a list too:


<ol>
<li> Mark 1.
<li> Mark 2.
</ol>

Filenames: <code>flip_coin.py</code>, <code>flip_coin.pdf</code>.

<!-- Closing remarks for this Problem -->

==== Remarks ====

These are the exercise remarks, appearing at the very end.

<!-- solution files: mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py, yet_another.file -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


==== Not an exercise ====

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Exercise 3: Test of plain text exercise ====

Very short exercise. What is the capital
of Norway?
Filename: <code>myexer1.py</code>.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Project 4: Compute a Probability ====

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval <math>[0,1)</math>?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint.''
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw <math>N</math> such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, <math>M</math>, that fall in the interval <math>(0.5,0.6)</math>, and
compute the probability as <math>M/N</math>.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by

:<math>
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
</math>
where <math>R</math> is the radius of the circle, <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> is the
center point, and <math>t</math> is a parameter in the unit interval <math>[0,1]</math>.
For any <math>t</math>, <math>(x,y)</math> is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution -->
<!-- which we normally want to keep where they are. -->

The goal of this project is to draw <math>N</math> circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the <code>circle</code> function
above.


''a)''
Let <math>R</math> be normally distributed and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> uniformly distributed.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

''Hint.''
Use the <code>numpy.random</code> module to draw the
<math>x_0</math>, <math>y_0</math>, and <math>R</math> quantities.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
''Answer.''
Here goes the short answer to part a).

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
''Solution.''
Here goes a full solution to part a).

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

''b)''
Let <math>R</math> be uniformly distributed and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> normally distributed.
Filename: <code>norm.py</code>.

''c)''
Let <math>R</math> and <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> be normally distributed.

<!-- No meaning in this weired test example: -->
The text here belongs to the main (intro) part of the exercise. Need
closing remarks to have text after subexercises.

Test list in exercise:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
<!-- Closing remarks for this Exercise -->
</ol>

==== Remarks ====

Some final closing remarks, e.g., summarizing the main findings
and their implications in other problems can be made. These
remarks will appear at the end of the typeset exercise.


<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix ====

<!-- Another minimalistic exercise -->

Just some text. And some math saying that <math>e^0=1</math> on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

:<math>
 \exp{(0)} = 1 
</math>

And a test that the code <code>lambda x: x+2</code> is correctly placed here:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
lambda x: x+2
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- the Filename: ... is written correctly. -->
<!-- Have some comments at the end of the exercise to see that -->

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation ====



Given

:<math>
 \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 
</math>
What is the solution of this equation?

Choice A: <math>y=e^{-y}</math>

Choice B: <math>y=e^{y}</math>

Choice C: <syntaxhighlight lang="python">
from math import exp
def f(x):
    return exp(x)
</syntaxhighlight>

Choice D: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

Choice E: The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for <math>x</math> or <math>y</math>, not a function <math>y(x)</math>.


<!-- --- end explanation of choice 5 --- -->
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

==== Example 9: Just an example ====

<!-- This example needs the --examples_as_exercises option, otherwise -->
<!-- it is just typeset as it is written. -->


''a)''
What is the capital of Norway?

''Answer.''
Oslo.

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/ Script for Introduction to Version Control] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [http://dropbox.com Dropbox] and [http://drive.google.com Google Drive].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


==== Appendix: Testing inline comments ====

<!-- Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+ -->

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like
<math>\partial u/\partial t</math>, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

==== Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code> ====

The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


{{quote box
| quote = ''Fun is fun.''--- Unknown.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
}}



And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

[^example-of-the-third-footnote]: Not much to add here, but the footnote
is at the end with only one newline.

=== Computer code ===

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

{{{
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}
and then just the subroutine,
{{{

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
}}}
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
({{{envir=ccq}}}):
{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Testing other code environments. First Python:

{{{
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
}}}
which gets rendered as

{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

//Paragraph heading before code.//

{{{
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
}}}

=== Subsubsection heading before code ===

{{{
def h(z):
    return z+1
}}}

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.

{{{
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
}}}

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

{{{
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
}}}


Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

Standard Python shell sessions:

{{{
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
}}}

IPython sessions:

{{{
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
}}}


<wiki:comment> This one tests a + sign before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
<wiki:comment> The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> It also tests emoji before code </wiki:comment>
And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:

{{{
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
}}}
which then is typeset as

{{{
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
}}}

HTML:

{{{
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
}}}

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
{{{<a href="}}} (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

{{{
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
}}}
results in

{{{
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
}}}

<wiki:comment> Here goes hidden code. </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out. </wiki:comment>





Finally, {{{!bc do}}} supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

{{{
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
}}}

It is time to test {{{verbatim inline font}}} especially with {{{a newline
inside the text}}} and an exclamation mark at the end: {{{BEGIN}}}! For
spellcheck, test {{{a verbatim expression}}} in {{{another}}} in a {{{third}}}.
Also test exclamation mark as in {{{!bc}}} and {{{!ec}}} as well as {{{a != b}}}.
Also test backslashes and braces like {{{\begin}}}, {{{\begin{enumerate}}}},
{{{\end{this}\end{that}}}}, and {{{{something \inside braces}}}}.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format cwiki.
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak<br />
code.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when {{{html}}} <br />
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

=== Running OS commands ===

{{{
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
}}}


=== Footnotes ===

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in


 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 * even with math {{{\nabla^2u}}}[^math1]
 * and code {{{h[i] += 1}}}[^code]   (//must// have space between inline code and footnote!)
 * and [[http://google.com|links]][^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: [[google.com]] is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

//Non-breaking space character.// 
This paragraph aims to test [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space|non-breaking space character]], and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 km is traveled
in {{{7.4/5.5\approx 1.345}}} s.  Also check that a~[[http://google.com|link]]~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in {{{[~x for x in y]}}} or in {{{y=~x}}}, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)



== Subsection 2: Testing figures ==


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.

{{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png| Visualization of a wave. (fig:impact)}}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

{{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png|}}



<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

{{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png| A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like {{{my_file_v1}}} and {{{my_file_v2}}} as well as math with subscript as in {{{t_{i+1}}}}. (myfig) }}

<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>

Test URL as figure name:

{{https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png|}}


<wiki:comment> Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs </wiki:comment>


//Remark.//
Movies are tested in separate file {{{movies.do.txt}}}.


<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

== The {{{\theta}}} parameter (not {{{\nabla}}}?) ==


Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving {{{\theta}}}:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

//More on {{{\theta}}}.// Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
{{{\frac{1}{2}}}}, {{{{1/2}}}}, {{{\pmb{x}}}}, {{{\frac{Du}{dt}}}},
both inline and in block:

{{{
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
}}}

Or with align with label and numbers:

{{{
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
}}}


== Custom Environments ==

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {{{.tex}}} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



//Theorem 5.//
Let {{{a=1}}} and {{{b=2}}}. Then {{{c=3}}}.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
//Proof.//
Since {{{c=a+b}}}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


== Tables ==



<wiki:comment> index with comma could fool sphinx </wiki:comment>

Let us take this table from the manual:



 | =time     | =velocity     | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0      |  1.4186       |  -5.01            |
 |  2.0      |  1.376512     |  11.919           |
 |  4.0      |  1.1E+1       |  14.717624        |



The DocOnce source code reads
{{{

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 | =time     | =velocity     | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0      |  1.4186       |  -5.01            |
 |  1.0      |  1.376512     |  11.919           |
 |  3.0      |  1.1E+1       |  14.717624        |


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


 | ={{{i}}}     | ={{{h_i}}}     | ={{{\bar T_i}}}     | ={{{L_i}}}     |
 |  0           |  0             |  288                |  -0.0065       |
 |  1           |  11,000        |  216                |  0.0           |
 |  2           |  20,000        |  216                |  0.001         |
 |  3           |  32,000        |  228                |  0.0028        |
 |  4           |  47,000        |  270                |  0.0           |
 |  5           |  51,000        |  270                |  -0.0028       |
 |  6           |  71,000        |  214                |  {{{NaN}}}     |


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with {{{|-}}} because of a negative number,
and {{{|}}} right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


 | =exact     | ={{{v_1}}}     | ={{{a_i}}} + {{{v_2}}}     | ={{{verb_3_}}}     |
 |  9         |  9.62          |  5.57                      |  8.98              |
 |  -20       |  -23.39        |  -7.65                     |  -19.93            |
 |  10        |  17.74         |  -4.50                     |  9.96              |
 |  0         |  -9.19         |  4.13                      |  -0.26             |


Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:


 | ={{{S}}}           | =command               |
 |  $ ||a_0|| $       |  {{{norm|length}}}     |
 |  {{{x\cap y}}}     |  {{{x|y}}}             |


Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

//Ampersand.//
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as {{{Hennes & Mauritz}}} and {{{H & M}}}.
A sole {{{&}}} must also work.
<wiki:comment> Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text. </wiki:comment>

{{{
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
}}}

//Quotes.//
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like {{{.txt}}}.


== Bibliography test ==

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

== Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises ==


Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with {{{Example:}}}

<wiki:comment> --- end exercise --- </wiki:comment>


== User-defined environments ==



The example in the section [#Example_1:_A_test_function] demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function {{{add}}} appears in
the example in the section [#Example_1:_A_test_function].



== Example 1: A test function ==


Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

{{{
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
}}}





== Example 2: Addition ==


We have

{{{
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]
}}}



//Highlight box!// 
This environment is used to highlight something:

{{{
\[ E = mc^2 \]
}}}





== URLs ==


Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]], or
the entire URL if desired, [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]].  Here is a
plain file link [[testdoc.do.txt]], or [[testdoc.do.txt]], or
[[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt|a link with
newline]]. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]] or [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]]. Also {{{file:///}}} works: [[file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html|link to a
file]] is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]], if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [[mailto:hpl@simula.no|{{{hpl@simula.no}}}]], or just a [[mailto:hpl@simula.no|mail link]], or a raw [[mailto:hpl@simula.no]].

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the {{{latex}}} format:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas|Newton-Cotes]] formulas
and a [[http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1|good book]]. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas]]
and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae]] which has a shebang.

For the {{{--device=paper}}} option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the {{{--latex_no_program_footnotelink}}}
is used), as in this reference to
[[https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py|{{{decay_mod}}}]], [[http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py|{{{ball1.py}}}]],
and [[http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py|{{{ball2.py}}}]].


<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> format extra blanks make a paragraph break). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if rst output is desired, but placed in a {{{_static*}}} folder. </wiki:comment>

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
{{{--device=paper}}} option must be correct. We have
[[http://google.com|google]], [[http://google.com|google]], and
[[http://google.com|google]], which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<wiki:comment> !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment </wiki:comment>

= LaTeX Mathematics =

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
{{{
\[ a = b + c \]
}}}
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
{{{
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
{{{
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
}}}



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have [#Problem_2:_Flip_a_Coin] and [#Project_4:_Compute_a_Probability],
as well as [#Project_5:_Explore_Distributions_of_Random_Circles] and [#Project_11:_References_to_Project_demo:ex:2_in_a_heading_works_for_cwiki], and in

== Project 4: Compute a Probability ==


<wiki:comment> Minimalistic exercise </wiki:comment>


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval {{{[0,1)}}}?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

//Hint.//
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw {{{N}}} such random numbers using Python's standard {{{random}}} module,
count how many of them, {{{M}}}, that fall in the interval {{{(0.5,0.6)}}}, and
compute the probability as {{{M/N}}}.

== Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles ==


The formula for a circle is given by

{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where {{{R}}} is the radius of the circle, {{{(x_0,y_0)}}} is the
center point, and {{{t}}} is a parameter in the unit interval {{{[0,1]}}}.
For any {{{t}}}, {{{(x,y)}}} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {{{n}}} points on a circle:

{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>

//Tip.// 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [[http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/|Script for Introduction to Version Control]] provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [[http://dropbox.com|Dropbox]] and [[http://drive.google.com|Google Drive]].
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to [[http://dropbox.com]] and watch the video. It explains
how files, like {{{myfile.py}}}, perhaps containing much math, like
{{{\partial u/\partial t}}}, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

Section 1

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

Here are two references. Equation (ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq. (ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.

Subsection 1

More text, with a reference back to
the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
encourages you to do the tasks in  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".
Appendices     "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.

Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence

The section "Subsection 1" is fine.
The section "URLs" too.

Computer code

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::

        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
('envir=ccq')::

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

Testing other code environments. First Python::

        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::

        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()

Then Cython::

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1

Standard Python shell sessions::

        >>> from numpy import sin
        >>> # Some comment
        >>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions::

        In [1]: from numpy import sin
        
        In [2]: # Some comment
        
        In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

C++::

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face::

        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end

HTML::

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
'<a href="' (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call::

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.::

        !bc restructuredtext
        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.
        !ec

results in::

        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.

Finally, '!bc do' supports highlighting of DocOnce source::

        ======= DocOnce test file =======
        
        ===== Computer code =====
        
        Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
        code blocks:
        
        !bc pycod
        from math import sin
        
        def f(x):
            """Example on a function."""
            return sin(x) + 1
        
        print f(0)
        !ec
        
        
        ===== Mathematics =====
        
        Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
        as equations:
        
        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
        \end{align*}
        !et
        
        === Subsubsection heading ===
        
        DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
        
        __Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.

It is time to test 'verbatim inline font' especially with 'a newline
inside the text' and an exclamation mark at the end: 'BEGIN'! For
spellcheck, test 'a verbatim expression' in 'another' in a 'third'.
Also test exclamation mark as in '!bc' and '!ec' as well as 'a != b'.
Also test backslashes and braces like '\begin', '\begin{enumerate}',
'\end{this}\end{that}', and '{something \inside braces}'.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format st.
Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak
code. Some formats will only display 
this correctly when 'html' 
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands::

        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.

Footnotes

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 - list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 - even with math \nabla^2u[^math1]
 - and code 'h[i] += 1'[^code]
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)
 - and "http://google.com":links[^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: "google.com":google.com is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

*Non-breaking space character.* 
This paragraph aims to test "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space":non-breaking space character, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 km is traveled
in 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345 s.  Also check that a~"http://google.com":link is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in '[~x for x in y]' or in 'y=~x', and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)



Subsection 2: Testing figures

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like 'my_file_v1' and 'my_file_v2' as well as math with subscript as in t_{i+1}. {myfig} 

Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

*Remark.*
Movies are tested in separate file 'movies.do.txt'.

The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::

        def f(theta):
            return theta**2

*More on \theta.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}

Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the '.tex' by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

*Theorem 5.*
Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.*
Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

Tables

Let us take this table from the manual:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The DocOnce source code reads::

        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     
====  ========  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

=  ======  ========  =======  
i   h_i    \bar T_i   'L_i'   
=  ======  ========  =======  
0       0       288  -0.0065  
1  11,000       216      0.0  
2  20,000       216    0.001  
3  32,000       228   0.0028  
4  47,000       270      0.0  
5  51,000       270  -0.0028  
6  71,000       214    'NaN'  
=  ======  ========  =======  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with '|-' because of a negative number,
and '|' right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====  ======  ===========  =========  
exact  'v_1'   a_i + 'v_2'  'verb_3_'  
=====  ======  ===========  =========  
    9    9.62         5.57       8.98  
  -20  -23.39        -7.65     -19.93  
   10   17.74        -4.50       9.96  
    0   -9.19         4.13      -0.26  
=====  ======  ===========  =========  

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

===========  =======  =======  
     S       command  
===========  =======  =======  
$ ||a_0|| $    'norm  
x\cap y           'x  
===========  =======  =======  

Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: 'my_file_v1' and 'my_file_v2'

*Paragraph with verbatim and math: 'my_file_v1.py' and 'my_file_v2.py' define some math a_{i-1}.* Here is more '__verbatim__' code and
some plain text on a new line.

**Just bold**

Some text.

*Just emphasize*

Some text.

'Just verbatim'

Some text.

**Bold** beginning

Some text.

*Emphasize* beginning

Some text.

'Verbatim' beginning

Some text.

Maybe **bold end**

Some text.

Maybe *emphasize end*

Some text.

Maybe 'verbatim end'

Some text.

The middle has **bold** word

Some text.

The middle has *emphasize* word

Some text.

The middle has 'verbatim' word

Some text.

**Just emphasize*.* Some text.

*'Just verbatim'.* Some text.

**Emphasize* beginning.* Some text.

*'Verbatim beginning'.* Some text.

*Maybe *emphasize end*.* Some text.

*Maybe 'verbatim end'.* Some text.

*The middle has *emphasize* word.* Some text.

*The middle has 'verbatim' word.* Some text.

*Ampersand.*
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as 'Hennes & Mauritz' and 'H & M'.
A sole '&' must also work::

        # Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
        c = a & b

*Quotes.*
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like '.txt'.

Bibliography test

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with 'Example:'
and then, with the command-line option '--examples_as_exercises' be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

*a)*
State some problem.

*Solution.*
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)*
State some other problem.

*Hint 1.*
A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.*
Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.*
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---

User-defined environments

The example in the section "Example 1: A test function" demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function 'add' appears in
the example in the section "Example 1: A test function".

Example 1: A test function

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition::

        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def test_add():
            a = 1; b = 1
            expected = a + b
            computed = add(a, b)
            assert expected == computed

Example 2: Addition

We have::

        \[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

*Highlight box!* 
This environment is used to highlight something::

        \[ E = mc^2 \]



URLs

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl, or
the entire URL if desired, "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt, or "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt, or
"testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt or "testdoc.do.txt":testdoc.do.txt or "testdoc.do.txt":a link with
newline. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl or "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl. Also 'file:///' works: "file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html":link to a
file is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: mailto:hpl@simula.no:'hpl@simula.no', or just a "mailto:hpl@simula.no":mail link, or a raw "mailto:hpl@simula.no":mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the 'latex' format:
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas":Newton-Cotes formulas
and a "http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1":good book. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the '--device=paper' option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the '--latex_no_program_footnotelink'
is used), as in this reference to
https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py:'decay_mod', http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py:'ball1.py',
and http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py:'ball2.py'.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
'--device=paper' option must be correct. We have
"http://google.com":google, "http://google.com":google, and
"http://google.com":google, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

LaTeX Mathematics

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 4: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 11: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for st", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".

Exercises

# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin

*a)*
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 1.*
Use 'r = random.random()' and define head as 'r <= 0.5'.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 2.*
Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
'r = random.randint(1,2)' and define head when 'r' is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.*
If the 'random.random()' function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---

# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.*::

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

# --- end solution of exercise ---

*b)*
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

*c)*
Vectorize the code in a) using 'numpy.sum'.

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.*
'np.sum(np.where(r <= 0.5, 1, 0))' or 'np.sum(r <= 0.5)'.

# --- end answer of exercise ---

In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.

My remarks

Remarks with such a subsubsection is treated as more text
after the last subexercise. Test a list too:

1. Mark 1.
2. Mark 2.

Filenames: 'flip_coin.py', 'flip_coin.pdf'.

Remarks

These are the exercise remarks, appearing at the very end.

# --- end exercise ---

Not an exercise

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

# --- begin exercise ---

Exercise 3: Test of plain text exercise

Very short exercise. What is the capital
of Norway?
Filename: 'myexer1.py'.

# --- end exercise ---

# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Compute a Probability

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.*
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard 'random' module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---

# --- begin exercise ---

Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate 'n' points on a circle::

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)

The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the 'circle' function
above.

Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation




Question: Given::

        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 \]

What is the solution of this equation?

Choice A: y=e^{-y}

Choice B: y=e^{y}

Choice C: 
Code::

        from math import exp
        def f(x):
            return exp(x)

Choice D: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

Choice E: The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for x or y, not a function y(x).

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.



Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent "http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/":Script for Introduction to Version Control provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are "http://dropbox.com":Dropbox and "http://drive.google.com":Google Drive.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

Appendix: Testing inline comments

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to "http://dropbox.com":http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like 'myfile.py', perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

Q>0, because [del 6: a] negative [edit 7: quantity is -> quantities

Appendix: Testing headings ending with 'verbatim inline'

The point here is to test 1) 'verbatim' code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:





And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: 'admon.do.txt'.

is at the end with only one newline.

I{Abstract.} This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

  - and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line

I{Here is a list with paragraph heading.}

  - item1
  - item2

Here is a list with subsubsection heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - item1

Here are two references. Equation (ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq. (ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.

Subsection 1
------------

More text, with a reference back to
the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
encourages you to do the tasks in  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".
Appendices     "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.

Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The section "Subsection 1" is fine.
The section "URLs" too.

Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::

        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(C{envir=ccq})::

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

Testing other code environments. First Python::

        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::

        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()

Then Cython::

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1

Standard Python shell sessions::

        >>> from numpy import sin
        >>> # Some comment
        >>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions::

        In [1]: from numpy import sin
        
        In [2]: # Some comment
        
        In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

C++::

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face::

        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end

HTML::

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
C{<a href="} (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call::

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.::

        !bc restructuredtext
        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.
        !ec

results in::

        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.

Finally, C{!bc do} supports highlighting of DocOnce source::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

It is time to test C{verbatim inline font} especially with C{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: C{BEGIN}! For
spellcheck, test C{a verbatim expression} in C{another} in a C{third}.
Also test exclamation mark as in C{!bc} and C{!ec} as well as C{a != b}.
Also test backslashes and braces like C{\begin}, C{\begin{enumerate}},
C{\end{this}\end{that}}, and C{{something \inside braces}}.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format epytext.
Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak
code. Some formats will only display 
this correctly when C{html} 
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 - list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 - even with math M{\nabla^2u}[^math1]
 - and code C{h[i] += 1}[^code]
   (I{must} have space between inline code and footnote!)
 - and U{links<http://google.com>}[^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: U{google.com<google.com>} is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

I{Non-breaking space character.} 
This paragraph aims to test U{non-breaking space character<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space>}, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 km is traveled
in M{7.4/5.5\approx 1.345} s.  Also check that a U{link<http://google.com>} is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in C{[~x for x in y]} or in C{y=~x}, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)



Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like C{my_file_v1} and C{my_file_v2} as well as math with subscript as in M{t_{i+1}}. {myfig} 

Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

I{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file C{movies.do.txt}.

The M{\theta} parameter (not M{\nabla}?)
----------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving M{\theta}::

        def f(theta):
            return theta**2

I{More on M{\theta}.} Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
M{\frac{1}{2}}, M{{1/2}}, M{\pmb{x}}, M{\frac{Du}{dt}},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the C{.tex} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

I{Theorem 5.}
Let M{a=1} and M{b=2}. Then M{c=3}.

I{Proof.}
Since M{c=a+b}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
M{END}

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

Tables
------

Let us take this table from the manual:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The DocOnce source code reads::

        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     
====  ========  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

====  ======  ===========  =======  
M{i}  M{h_i}  M{\bar T_i}   C{L_i}  
====  ======  ===========  =======  
0          0          288  -0.0065  
1     11,000          216      0.0  
2     20,000          216    0.001  
3     32,000          228   0.0028  
4     47,000          270      0.0  
5     51,000          270  -0.0028  
6     71,000          214   C{NaN}  
====  ======  ===========  =======  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with C{|-} because of a negative number,
and C{|} right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====  ======  ===============  ==========  
exact  C{v_1}  M{a_i} + C{v_2}  C{verb_3_}  
=====  ======  ===============  ==========  
    9    9.62             5.57        8.98  
  -20  -23.39            -7.65      -19.93  
   10   17.74            -4.50        9.96  
    0   -9.19             4.13       -0.26  
=====  ======  ===============  ==========  

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

===========  ==============  
    M{S}        command      
===========  ==============  
$ ||a_0|| $  C{norm|length}  
M{x\cap y}           C{x|y}  
===========  ==============  

Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript M{a_i}: C{my_file_v1} and C{my_file_v2}

I{Paragraph with verbatim and math: C{my_file_v1.py} and C{my_file_v2.py} define some math M{a_{i-1}}.} Here is more C{__verbatim__} code and

I{Ampersand.}
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as C{Hennes & Mauritz} and C{H & M}.
A sole C{&} must also work::

        # Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
        c = a & b

I{Quotes.}
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like C{.txt}.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with C{Example:}
and then, with the command-line option C{--examples_as_exercises} be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

I{a)}
State some problem.

I{Solution.}
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

I{b)}
State some other problem.

I{Hint 1.}
A hint can be given.

I{Hint 2.}
Maybe even another hint?

I{Solution.}
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---

User-defined environments
-------------------------

The example in the section "Example 1: A test function" demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function C{add} appears in
the example in the section "Example 1: A test function".

Example 1: A test function
--------------------------

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition::

        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def test_add():
            a = 1; b = 1
            expected = a + b
            computed = add(a, b)
            assert expected == computed

Example 2: Addition
-------------------

We have::

        \[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

I{Highlight box!} 
This environment is used to highlight something::

        \[ E = mc^2 \]



URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}, or
the entire URL if desired, U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.  Here is a
plain file link U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or
U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{a link with
newline<testdoc.do.txt>}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>} or U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}. Also C{file:///} works: U{link to a
file<file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>} is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: U{C{hpl@simula.no}<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}, or just a U{mail link<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}, or a raw U{mailto:hpl@simula.no<mailto:hpl@simula.no>}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the C{latex} format:
U{Newton-Cotes<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>} formulas
and a U{good book<http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
U{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>}
and U{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>} which has a shebang.

For the C{--device=paper} option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the C{--latex_no_program_footnotelink}
is used), as in this reference to
U{C{decay_mod}<https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>}, U{C{ball1.py}<http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>},
and U{C{ball2.py}<http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>}.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
C{--device=paper} option must be correct. We have
U{google<http://google.com>}, U{google<http://google.com>}, and
U{google<http://google.com>}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 4: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 11: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for epytext", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".

Exercises
=========

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin M{N} times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint 1.}
Use C{r = random.random()} and define head as C{r <= 0.5}.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint 2.}
Draw an integer among M{\{1,2\}} with
C{r = random.randint(1,2)} and define head when C{r} is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
I{Answer.}
If the C{random.random()} function returns a number M{<1/2}, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this M{N} number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---

# --- begin solution of exercise ---
I{Solution.}::

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

# --- end solution of exercise ---

I{b)}
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

I{c)}
Vectorize the code in a) using C{numpy.sum}.

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
I{Answer.}
C{np.sum(np.where(r <= 0.5, 1, 0))} or C{np.sum(r <= 0.5)}.

# --- end answer of exercise ---

In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.

My remarks

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

Exercise 3: Test of plain text exercise
---------------------------------------

Very short exercise. What is the capital
of Norway?
Filename: C{myexer1.py}.

# --- end exercise ---

# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval M{[0,1)}?

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw M{N} such random numbers using Python's standard C{random} module,
count how many of them, M{M}, that fall in the interval M{(0.5,0.6)}, and
compute the probability as M{M/N}.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---

# --- begin exercise ---

Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where M{R} is the radius of the circle, M{(x_0,y_0)} is the
center point, and M{t} is a parameter in the unit interval M{[0,1]}.
For any M{t}, M{(x,y)} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate C{n} points on a circle::

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)

The goal of this project is to draw M{N} circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the C{circle} function
above.

I{a)}
Let M{R} be normally distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

I{Hint.}
Use the C{numpy.random} module to draw the
M{x_0}, M{y_0}, and M{R} quantities.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
I{Answer.}
Here goes the short answer to part a).

# --- end answer of exercise ---

# --- begin solution of exercise ---
I{Solution.}
Here goes a full solution to part a).

# --- end solution of exercise ---

I{b)}
Let M{R} be uniformly distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} normally distributed.
Filename: C{norm.py}.

I{c)}
Let M{R} and M{(x_0,y_0)} be normally distributed.

Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix
--------------------------------------------

Just some text. And some math saying that M{e^0=1} on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct::

        \[ \exp{(0)} = 1 \]

And a test that the code C{lambda x: x+2} is correctly placed here::

        lambda x: x+2

# --- begin exercise ---

Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation
---------------------------------------------




Question: Given::

        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 \]

What is the solution of this equation?

Choice A: M{y=e^{-y}}

Choice B: M{y=e^{y}}

Choice C: 
Code::

        from math import exp
        def f(x):
            return exp(x)

Choice D: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

Choice E: The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for M{x} or M{y}, not a function M{y(x)}.

I{Tip.} 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.



Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent U{Script for Introduction to Version Control<http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/>} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

I{Summary.}

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are U{Dropbox<http://dropbox.com>} and U{Google Drive<http://drive.google.com>}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to U{http://dropbox.com<http://dropbox.com>} and watch the video. It explains
how files, like C{myfile.py}, perhaps containing much math, like
M{\partial u/\partial t}, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

------

First[add 4: ,] consider a quantity M{Q}. [edit 5: To this end, -> We note that]
M{Q>0}, because [del 6: a] negative [edit 7: quantity is -> quantities
are] [del 8: just] negative. [add 9: This comes as no surprise.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with C{verbatim inline}
---------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) C{verbatim} code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:





And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: C{admon.do.txt}.

[^example-of-the-third-footnote]: Not much to add here, but the footnote
is at the end with only one newline.

The format of this document is
plain

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2

  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line

*Here is a list with paragraph heading.*

  * item1

  * item2

Here is a list with subsubsection heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * item1

  * item2

        Here are two lines that make up
        a block quote for testing *emphasized words* and _boldface words_,
        also with hypens:
        *pre*-fix, post-*fix*, _pre_-fix, post-_fix_.


Here are two references. Equation (ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq. (ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.

Subsection 1
------------

More text, with a reference back to
the section "Section 1" and "Subsection 1", and further to the
the sections "Subsection 1" and "URLs", which
encourages you to do the tasks in  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".
Appendices     "Appendix: Just for testing; part I" and "Appendix: Just for testing; part II" are also nice elements.

Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The section "Subsection 1" is fine.
The section "URLs" too.

Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::

        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(envir=ccq)::

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

Testing other code environments. First Python::

        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as::

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format::

        class Line:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a, self.b = a, b
        
            def __call__(self, x):
                a, b = self.a, self.b
                return a*x + b
        
        line = Line(2, 1)
        y = line(x=3)
        print y

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format)::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()

Then Cython::

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1

Standard Python shell sessions::

        >>> from numpy import sin
        >>> # Some comment
        >>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions::

        In [1]: from numpy import sin
        
        In [2]: # Some comment
        
        In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

C++::

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face::

        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as::

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end

HTML::

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
<a href=" (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call::

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.::

        !bc restructuredtext
        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.
        !ec

results in::

        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.

Finally, !bc do supports highlighting of DocOnce source::

        ======= DocOnce test file =======
        
        ===== Computer code =====
        
        Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
        code blocks:
        
        !bc pycod
        from math import sin
        
        def f(x):
            """Example on a function."""
            return sin(x) + 1
        
        print f(0)
        !ec
        
        
        ===== Mathematics =====
        
        Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
        as equations:
        
        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
        \end{align*}
        !et
        
        === Subsubsection heading ===
        
        DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
        
        __Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.

It is time to test verbatim inline font especially with a newline
inside the text and an exclamation mark at the end: BEGIN! For
spellcheck, test a verbatim expression in another in a third.
Also test exclamation mark as in !bc and !ec as well as a != b.
Also test backslashes and braces like \begin, \begin{enumerate},
\end{this}\end{that}, and {something \inside braces}.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format plain.
Here is some red color and an attempt to write with
green color containing a linebreak
code. Some formats will only display 
this correctly when html 
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 * even with math \nabla^2u[^math1]

 * and code h[i] += 1[^code]
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)

 * and links (http://google.com)[^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: google.com is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


Non-breaking space character -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                                                                           |
| This paragraph aims to test non-breaking space character (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space), and a typical |
| example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 km is traveled                                                     |
| in 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345 s.  Also check that a link (http://google.com) is                                                 |
| not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).                                                           |
| (On the other hand, the tilde is used in                                                                                  |
| computer code, e.g., as in [~x for x in y] or in y=~x, and should                                                         |
| of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200] Visualization of a wave. {fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

FIGURE:[../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D, width=200]

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

FIGURE: [../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png, width=500] A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like my_file_v1 and my_file_v2 as well as math with subscript as in t_{i+1}. {myfig} 

Test URL as figure name:

FIGURE: [https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png, width=500, frac=0.8]

*Remark.*
Movies are tested in separate file movies.do.txt.

The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)
----------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::

        def f(theta):
            return theta**2

*More on \theta.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\frac{1}{2}, {1/2}, \pmb{x}, \frac{Du}{dt},
both inline and in block::

        \begin{align*}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        \end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers::

        \begin{align}
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        label{aligneq1}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        label{aligneq2}
        \end{align}

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the .tex by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

*Theorem 5.*
Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.*
Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

Tables
------

Let us take this table from the manual:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The DocOnce source code reads::

        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     
====  ========  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

=  ======  ========  =======  
i   h_i    \bar T_i    L_i    
=  ======  ========  =======  
0       0       288  -0.0065  
1  11,000       216      0.0  
2  20,000       216    0.001  
3  32,000       228   0.0028  
4  47,000       270      0.0  
5  51,000       270  -0.0028  
6  71,000       214      NaN  
=  ======  ========  =======  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with |- because of a negative number,
and | right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====  ======  =========  =======  
exact   v_1    a_i + v_2  verb_3_  
=====  ======  =========  =======  
    9    9.62       5.57     8.98  
  -20  -23.39      -7.65   -19.93  
   10   17.74      -4.50     9.96  
    0   -9.19       4.13    -0.26  
=====  ======  =========  =======  

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

===========  =======  ======  
     S       command  
===========  =======  ======  
$ ||a_0|| $     norm  
x\cap y            x  
===========  =======  ======  

NOTE: The above table is not correctly handled in the plain text format
because in this format inline verbatim text look like normal text,
and the first line in the table then looks like three columns.

Finally, a table with math
and URLs.

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript a_i: my_file_v1 and my_file_v2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Paragraph with verbatim and math: my_file_v1.py and my_file_v2.py define some math a_{i-1}.* Here is more __verbatim__ code and
some plain text on a new line.

_Just bold_
-----------

Some text.

*Just emphasize*
----------------

Some text.

Just verbatim
-------------

Some text.

_Bold_ beginning
----------------

*Emphasize* beginning
---------------------

----------------------------

Some text.

**Just emphasize*.* Some text.

*Just verbatim.* Some text.

**Emphasize* beginning.* Some text.

*Verbatim beginning.* Some text.

*Maybe *emphasize end*.* Some text.

*Maybe verbatim end.* Some text.

*The middle has *emphasize* word.* Some text.

*The middle has verbatim word.* Some text.

*Ampersand.*
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as Hennes & Mauritz and H & M.
A sole & must also work::

        # Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
        c = a & b

*Quotes.*
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like .txt.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [1] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [2] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [3].
The book chapter [4] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [5] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[1] [4].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[6] [3] [7] [1]
and
[2] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
and all the work of
[14] [4] [15] as well as
old work [5] and [16], and the
talk [17].
Langtangen also had two thesis [18] [16].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [19] and the
[20] OONSKI '94 paper.

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with Example:
and then, with the command-line option --examples_as_exercises be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

*a)*
State some problem.

*Solution.*
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)*
State some other problem.

*Hint 1.*
A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.*
Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.*
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

# --- end exercise ---

User-defined environments
-------------------------

The example in the section "Example 1: A test function" demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function add appears in
the example in the section "Example 1: A test function".

Example 1: A test function
--------------------------

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition::

        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def test_add():
            a = 1; b = 1
            expected = a + b
            computed = add(a, b)
            assert expected == computed

Example 2: Addition
-------------------

We have::

        \[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]


Highlight box! -------------------------------------|
|                                                   |
| This environment is used to highlight something:: |
|                                                   |
|         \[ E = mc^2 \]                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|


URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl), or
the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.  Here is a
plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt, or
testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or a link with
newline (testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces with the link with word
too: hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Also file:/// works: link to a
file (file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html) is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: hpl@simula.no (mailto:hpl@simula.no), or just a mail link (mailto:hpl@simula.no), or a raw mailto:hpl@simula.no.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the latex format:
Newton-Cotes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas
and a good book (http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1). Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae which has a shebang.

For the --device=paper option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the --latex_no_program_footnotelink
is used), as in this reference to
decay_mod (https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py), ball1.py (http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py),
and ball2.py (http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py).

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
--device=paper option must be correct. We have
google (http://google.com), google (http://google.com), and
google (http://google.com), which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

# !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  "Problem 2: Flip a Coin" and  "Project 4: Compute a Probability",
as well as  "Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles" and "Project 11: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for plain", and in
between there we have  "Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems".

Exercises
=========

# --- begin exercise ---

Problem 2: Flip a Coin
----------------------

*a)*
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 1.*
Use r = random.random() and define head as r <= 0.5.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint 2.*
Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
r = random.randint(1,2) and define head when r is 1.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.*
If the random.random() function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.

# --- end answer of exercise ---

# --- begin solution of exercise ---
*Solution.*::

        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)

# --- end solution of exercise ---

*b)*
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

*c)*
Vectorize the code in a) using numpy.sum.

# --- begin answer of exercise ---
*Answer.*
np.sum(np.where(r <= 0.5, 1, 0)) or np.sum(r <= 0.5).

# --- end answer of exercise ---

In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.

My remarks
~~~~~~~~~~

Remarks with such a subsubsection is treated as more text
after the last subexercise. Test a list too:

1. Mark 1.

2. Mark 2.

Filenames: flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf.

Remarks
~~~~~~~

These are the exercise remarks, appearing at the very end.

# --- end exercise ---

Not an exercise
---------------

Should be possible to stick a normal section in the middle of many
exercises.

# --- begin exercise ---

Exercise 3: Test of plain text exercise
---------------------------------------

Very short exercise. What is the capital
of Norway?
Filename: myexer1.py.

# --- end exercise ---

# --- begin exercise ---

Project 4: Compute a Probability
--------------------------------

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?

At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

1. item1

2. item2

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.*
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard random module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

# --- end hint in exercise ---

# --- end exercise ---

# --- begin exercise ---

Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
--------------------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate n points on a circle::

        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)

The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the circle function
above.

*a)*
Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

# --- begin hint in exercise ---

*Hint.*
Use the numpy.random module to draw the

Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation
---------------------------------------------




Question: Given::

        \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 \]

What is the solution of this equation?

Choice A: y=e^{-y}

Choice B: y=e^{y}

Choice C: 
Code::

        from math import exp
        def f(x):
            return exp(x)

Choice D: The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

Choice E: The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for x or y, not a function y(x).

|-----------------------------------------------------|


Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent Script for Introduction to Version Control (http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/) provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are Dropbox (http://dropbox.com) and Google Drive (http://drive.google.com).
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

Appendix: Testing inline comments
---------------------------------

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to http://dropbox.com and watch the video. It explains
how files, like myfile.py, perhaps containing much math, like
\partial u/\partial t, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

First[add 4: ,] consider a quantity Q. [edit 5: To this end, -> We note that]
Q>0, because [del 6: a] negative [edit 7: quantity is -> quantities
are] [del 8: just] negative. [add 9: This comes as no surprise.]

Appendix: Testing headings ending with verbatim inline
------------------------------------------------------

The point here is to test 1) verbatim code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

        *Fun is fun.*--- Unknown.


And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: admon.do.txt.

[^example-of-the-third-footnote]: Not much to add here, but the footnote
is at the end with only one newline.

The format of this document is
pandoc
*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->



## Section 1
<div id="sec1"></div>

Here is a nested list:

  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist
    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2

  * and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line


*Here is a list with paragraph heading.*

  * item1
  * item2

#### Here is a list with subsubsection heading

  * item1
  * item2

> Here are two lines that make up
> a block quote for testing *emphasized words* and **boldface words**,

Here are two references. Equation\ \eqref{my:eq1} is fine. Eq.\ \eqref{my:eq1} too.
Even Equation \eqref{my:eq1} without the tilde.


### Subsection 1
<div id="subsec1"></div>


<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

More text, with a reference back to
the section [Section 1](#sec1) and [Subsection 1](#subsec1), and further to the

encourages you to do the tasks in  [Problem 2: Flip a Coin](#demo:ex:1) and [Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems](#exer:some:formula).
Appendices     [Appendix: Just for testing; part I](#app1) and [Appendix: Just for testing; part II](#app2) are also nice elements.

#### Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence

The section [Subsection 1](#subsec1) is fine.
The section [URLs](#subsubsec:ex) too.


<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

#### Computer code

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then just the subroutine,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(`envir=ccq`):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing other code environments. First Python:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which gets rendered as


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

*Paragraph heading before code.*


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Subsubsection heading before code


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
def h(z):
    return z+1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a program that is supposed to be interactive via
Python Online Tutorial, but that service is not accessible
for the present format.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then Cython:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standard Python shell sessions:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IPython sessions:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- This one tests a + sign before a code environment -->
C++:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Cpp}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod) -->
<!-- It also tests emoji before code -->
And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which then is typeset as


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTML:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.HTML}
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
`<a href="` (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

results in


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- Here goes hidden code. -->
<!-- Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out. -->





Finally, `!bc do` supports highlighting of DocOnce source:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} &= 0,\\ 
\boldsymbol{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! For
spellcheck, test `a verbatim expression` in `another` in a `third`.
Also test exclamation mark as in `!bc` and `!ec` as well as `a != b`.
Also test backslashes and braces like `\begin`, `\begin{enumerate}`,
`\end{this}\end{that}`, and `{something \inside braces}`.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format pandoc.
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak\\n
code.</font> Some formats will only display \\n
this correctly when `html` \\n
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

#### Running OS commands


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Footnotes

Here is a test of footnotes [^footnote], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)
 * even with math $\nabla^2u$[^math1]
 * and code `h[i] += 1`[^code]
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)
 * and [links](http://google.com)[^google-search]

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third[^example-of-the-third-footnote] example.

  [^footnote]: Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.
[^math1]: Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.
[^code]: One-line footnote.

[^google-search]: <google.com> is perhaps the most famous
web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

*Non-breaking space character.* 
This paragraph aims to test [non-breaking space character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space), and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4\ km is traveled
in\ $7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$\ s.  Also check that a~[link](http://google.com)\ is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in `[~x for x in y]` or in `y=~x`, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)



### Subsection 2: Testing figures
<div id="subsec:ex"></div>

Test of figures. In particular we refer to [Figure](#fig:impact) in which
there is a flow.

<!-- <img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" width=200><p><em>Visualization of a wave. <div id="fig:impact"></div></em></p> -->
![<p><em>Visualization of a wave. <div id="fig:impact"></div></em></p>](../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png)

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<!-- <img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" width=200> -->
![](../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png)



<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

Here is [figure](#myfig) with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<!-- <img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" width=500><p><em>A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. <div id="myfig"></div></em></p> -->
![<p><em>A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2` as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. <div id="myfig"></div></em></p>](../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png)

<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

Test URL as figure name:

<!-- <img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png" width=500,> -->
![](https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png)


<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->


*Remark.*
Movies are tested in separate file `movies.do.txt`.


<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

### The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)
<div id="decay:sec:theta"></div>

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*More on $\theta$.* Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
$\frac{1}{2}$, ${1/2}$, $\pmb{x}$, $\frac{Du}{dt}$,
both inline and in block:

$$

\frac{Du}{dt} = 0


$$

$$
  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2}

$$

$$
  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}

$$

Or with align with label and numbers:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
\label{aligneq1}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
\label{aligneq2}
\end{equation}
$$


### Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<!-- begin theorem -->
<div id="theorem:fundamental1"></div>


*Theorem 5.*
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
<!-- end theorem -->

<!-- begin proof -->
*Proof.*
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
<!-- end proof -->

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


### Tables
<div id="subsec:table"></div>


<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

Let us take this table from the manual:



time  velocity  acceleration  
----  --------  ------------  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  



The DocOnce source code reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


time  velocity  acceleration  
----  --------  ------------  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     


And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


$i$  $h_i$   $\bar T_i$   `L_i`   
---  ------  ----------  -------  
0         0         288  -0.0065  
1    11,000         216      0.0  
2    20,000         216    0.001  
3    32,000         228   0.0028  
4    47,000         270      0.0  
5    51,000         270  -0.0028  
6    71,000         214    `NaN`  


And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with `|-` because of a negative number,
and `|` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):


exact  `v_1`   $a_i$ + `v_2`  `verb_3_`  
-----  ------  -------------  ---------  
    9    9.62           5.57       8.98  
  -20  -23.39          -7.65     -19.93  
   10   17.74          -4.50       9.96  
    0   -9.19           4.13      -0.26  


Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:


    $S$         command     
-----------  -------------  
$ ||a_0|| $  `norm|length`  
$x\cap y$            `x|y`  


Finally, a table with math
(`bm` that expands to `boldsymbol`, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->



                                                                                                                                                       
-------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------  
        $\mathcal{L}=0$          [`080`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0080.png)  [`085`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0085.png)  
             $a=b$               [`090`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0090.png)  [`095`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0095.png)  
$\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} =0 $  [`100`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0100.png)  [`105`](../doc/src/manual/mov/wave_frames/frame_0105.png)  



### A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript $a_i$: `my_file_v1` and `my_file_v2`

*Paragraph with verbatim and math: `my_file_v1.py` and `my_file_v2.py` define some math $a_{i-1}$.* Here is more `__verbatim__` code and
some plain text on a new line.

<!-- Test various types of headlines -->
### **Just bold**

Some text.

### *Just emphasize*

Some text.

### `Just verbatim`

Some text.

### **Bold** beginning

Some text.

### *Emphasize* beginning

Some text.

### `Verbatim` beginning

Some text.

### Maybe **bold end**

Some text.

### Maybe *emphasize end*

Some text.

### Maybe `verbatim end`

Some text.

### The middle has **bold** word

Some text.

### The middle has *emphasize* word

Some text.

### The middle has `verbatim` word

Some text.


**Just emphasize*.* Some text.


*`Just verbatim`.* Some text.


**Emphasize* beginning.* Some text.


*`Verbatim beginning`.* Some text.


*Maybe *emphasize end*.* Some text.


*Maybe `verbatim end`.* Some text.


*The middle has *emphasize* word.* Some text.


*The middle has `verbatim` word.* Some text.


*Ampersand.*
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as `Hennes & Mauritz` and `H & M`.
A sole `&` must also work.
<!-- Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text. -->


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
c = a & b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Quotes.*
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like `.txt`.


### Bibliography test

Here is an example: [@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002] discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [@Langtangen_et_al_2002] gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [@Langtangen_1994a].
The book chapter [@Mardal_et_al_2003a] contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [@Langtangen_1988d] about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002;@Mardal_et_al_2003a].

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[@Langtangen_1992c;@Langtangen_1994a;@Mortensen_et_al_2011;@Langtangen_Pedersen_2002]
and
[@Langtangen_et_al_2002;@Glimsdal_et_al_20006;@Rahman_et_al_2006b;@Haga_et_al_2011a;@Langtangen_2003a;@Langtangen_2008a;@Langtangen:95]
and all the work of
[@Langtangen_2012;@Mardal_et_al_2003a;@Jeberg_et_al_2004] as well as
old work [@Langtangen_1988d] and [@Langtangen_1989e], and the
talk [@Langtangen_talk_2007a].
Langtangen also had two thesis [@Langtangen:85;@Langtangen_1989e].
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [@Langtangen:91] and the
[@Langtangen:94b] OONSKI '94 paper.

### Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
<div id="Example"></div>

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with `Example:`
and then, with the command-line option `--examples_as_exercises` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.


*a)*
State some problem.

*Solution.*
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

*b)*
State some other problem.

*Hint 1.*
A hint can be given.

*Hint 2.*
Maybe even another hint?

*Solution.*
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->


### User-defined environments



The example in the section [Example 1: A test function](#ex:test:1p1) demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function `add` appears in
the example in the section [Example 1: A test function](#ex:test:1p1).



### Example 1: A test function
<div id="ex:test:1p1"></div>

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Example 2: Addition
<div id="ex:math:1p1"></div>

We have

$$
 1 + 1 = 2 
$$



*Highlight box!* 
This environment is used to highlight something:

$$
 E = mc^2 
$$





### URLs
<div id="subsubsec:ex"></div>

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl), or
the entire URL if desired, <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>.  Here is a
plain file link <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt>, or
<testdoc.do.txt> or <testdoc.do.txt> or [a link with
newline](testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces with the link with word
too: [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Also `file:///` works: [link to a
file](file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html) is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: [`hpl@simula.no`](mailto:hpl@simula.no), or just a [mail link](mailto:hpl@simula.no), or a raw <mailto:hpl@simula.no>.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the `latex` format:
[Newton-Cotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) formulas
and a [good book](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1). Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>
and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae> which has a shebang.

For the `--device=paper` option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the `--latex_no_program_footnotelink`
is used), as in this reference to
[`decay_mod`](https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py), [`ball1.py`](http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py),
and [`ball2.py`](http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py).


<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a `_static*` folder. -->

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
`--device=paper` option must be correct. We have
[google](http://google.com), [google](http://google.com), and
[google](http://google.com), which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



<!-- !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment -->

## LaTeX Mathematics

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$
 a = b + c 
$$
or with number and label, as in \eqref{my:eq1}, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to this equation by \eqref{my:eq1}.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
$$

\pmb{a} = \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} 

$$

$$
  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v

$$


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} 
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2}. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in `CG-2`.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.


More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have  [Problem 2: Flip a Coin](#demo:ex:1) and  [Project 4: Compute a Probability](#demo:ex:2),
as well as  [Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles](#proj:circle1) and [Project 11: References to Project ref{demo:ex:2} in a heading works for pandoc](#exer:you), and in
between there we have  [Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems](#exer:some:formula).


## Exercises



<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Problem 2: Flip a Coin
<div id="demo:ex:1"></div>
<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<!-- Torture tests -->


*a)*
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint 1.*
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint 2.*
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.*
If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
*Solution.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

*b)*
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

*c)*
Vectorize the code in a) using `numpy.sum`.


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.*
`np.sum(np.where(r <= 0.5, 1, 0))` or `np.sum(r <= 0.5)`.

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->

In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.


#### My remarks

after the last subexercise. Test a list too:

1. Mark 1.
2. Mark 2.

Filenames: `flip_coin.py`, `flip_coin.pdf`.

Very short exercise. What is the capital
of Norway?
Filename: `myexer1.py`.

<!-- --- end exercise --- -->




<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

### Project 4: Compute a Probability
<div id="demo:ex:2"></div>

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?


At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

1. item1
2. item2

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint.*
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

### Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles
<div id="proj:circle1"></div>

The formula for a circle is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
x = x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
y = y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{equation}
$$
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution -->
<!-- which we normally want to keep where they are. -->

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.


*a)*
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

*Hint.*
Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.

<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
*Answer.*
Here goes the short answer to part a).

<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->


<!-- --- begin solution of exercise --- -->
*Solution.*
Here goes a full solution to part a).

<!-- --- end solution of exercise --- -->

*b)*
Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.
Filename: `norm.py`.

*c)*
Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.

### Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix

<!-- Another minimalistic exercise -->

Just some text. And some math saying that $e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

$$
 \exp{(0)} = 1 
$$

And a test that the code `lambda x: x+2` is correctly placed here:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lambda x: x+2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<!-- the Filename: ... is written correctly. -->
<!-- Have some comments at the end of the exercise to see that -->

### Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation
<div id="sec:this:exer:de"></div>



Given

$$
 \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 
$$
What is the solution of this equation?

**Choice A:**
 $y=e^{-y}$

**Choice B:**
 $y=e^{y}$

**Choice C:**
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
from math import exp
def f(x):
    return exp(x)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Choice D:**
 The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

**Choice E:**
 The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for $x$ or $y$, not a function $y(x)$.

*Tip.* 
Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.





Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent [Script for Introduction to Version Control](http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/) provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

*Summary.*

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


### Appendix: Testing inline comments

<!-- Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+ -->

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <http://dropbox.com> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].

First[add 4: ,] consider a quantity $Q$. [edit 5: To this end, -> We note that]
$Q>0$, because [del 6: a] negative [edit 7: quantity is -> quantities
are] [del 8: just] negative. [add 9: This comes as no surprise.]

### Appendix: Testing headings ending with `verbatim inline`

The point here is to test 1) `verbatim` code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

> *Fun is fun.*--- Unknown.



And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: `admon.do.txt`.

[^example-of-the-third-footnote]: Not much to add here, but the footnote
is at the end with only one newline.

===== This is a 5 heading =====

The template can be any HTML file with header and footer and
three possible slots: *title*, *date* and *main*,
where *main* will become the DocOnce file (the main body of text),
*title* is the first heading in the DocOnce file, and
*date* is extracted from the DocOnce file (if present).

<h1 id="genrefs">Generalized References</h1> <hr>

<p>
Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, DocOnce offers <em>generalized references</em> which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the <code>xr</code> package,
the generalized references in DocOnce has a syntax that may utilize
the <code>xr</code> feature in LaTeX.

<p>
The syntax of generalized references reads
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">ref[internal][cite][external]
</pre></div>
<p>
If all <code>ref{label}</code> references in the text <code>internal</code> are references
to labels in the present document, the above <code>ref</code> command is replaced
by the text <code>internal</code>. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <code>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal cite</code> and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out <code>internal cite</code> since the <code>internal</code> reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the <code>internal</code> syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another LaTeX document, the output is just <code>cite</code>.
For all
output formats other than <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>, the <code>external</code>
text will be the output.

<p>
Here is an example on a specific generalized reference to a section
in a document:
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in &quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}][a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot; in
the document &quot;A Document for Testing DocOnce&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
With <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> as output, this translates to
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
if the label <code>{subsec:ex}</code> appears in the present DocOnce source, and
otherwise
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex} in &quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
In a format different from <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>, the effective DocOnce
text becomes
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex&quot; in
the document &quot;A Document for Testing DocOnce&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
The rendered text in the current format <code>html</code> becomes

<p>
<blockquote>
    As explained in
    a <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" target="_self">section</a> in
    the document <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html" target="_self">A Document for Testing DocOnce</a>
    <a href="#testdoc:12">[1]</a>, DocOnce documents may include tables.
</blockquote>


<p>
A reference to an entire external document, which is usually a chapter
if the reference is internal in the DocOnce source, applies the
<code>refch</code> syntax:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
refch[Chapter ref{ch:testdoc}][&quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}][the document
&quot;A Document for Testing DocOnce&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
The output now if <code>ch:testdoc</code> is not a label in the document,
becomes in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> case

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">As explained in
&quot;Langtangen, 2012&quot;:
&quot;http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html&quot;
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
</pre></div>
<p>
That is, the internal reference <code>Chapter ...</code> is omitted since
it is not meaningful to refer to an external document as "Chapter".
The resulting rendered text in the current format <code>html</code> becomes

<p>
<blockquote>
    As explained in
    the document
    <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html" target="_self">A Document for Testing DocOnce</a>
    <a href="#testdoc:12">[1]</a>, DocOnce documents may include tables.
</blockquote>


<p>
Note that LaTeX cannot
have links to local files, so a complete URL on the form
<code>http://...</code> must be used.

<p>
And here is another example with internal references only:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][dummy1][
dummy2].
</pre></div>
<p>
The text is rendered to

<p>
<blockquote>
    Generalized references are described in
    the section <a href="#genrefs">Generalized References</a>.
</blockquote>

\chapter{Generalized References}
\label{genrefs}

Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, DocOnce offers \emph{generalized references} which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since {\LaTeX} supports
references to labels in external documents via the \Verb!xr! package,
the generalized references in DocOnce has a syntax that may utilize
the \Verb!xr! feature in {\LaTeX}.

The syntax of generalized references reads
\bccq
ref[internal][cite][external]
\eccq
If all \Verb!ref{label}! references in the text \Verb!internal! are references
to labels in the present document, the above \Verb!ref! command is replaced
by the text \Verb!internal!. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is \Verb!latex! or \Verb!pdflatex! one assumes that the references in \Verb!internal!
are to external documents declared by a comment line \Verb!# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc! (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is \Verb!internal cite! and the
{\LaTeX} package \Verb!xr! is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out \Verb!internal cite! since the \Verb!internal! reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the \Verb!internal! syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another {\LaTeX} document, the output is just \Verb!cite!.
For all
output formats other than \Verb!latex! and \Verb!pdflatex!, the \Verb!external!
text will be the output.

Here is an example on a specific generalized reference to a section
in a document:
\bccq
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
\eccq
With \Verb!latex! or \Verb!pdflatex! as output, this translates to
\bccq
As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
\eccq
if the label \Verb!{subsec:ex}! appears in the present DocOnce source, and
otherwise
\bccq
As explained in
Section ref{subsec:ex} in "Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex"
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
\eccq
In a format different from \Verb!latex! and \Verb!pdflatex!, the effective DocOnce
text becomes
\bccq
As explained in
a "section":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex" in
the document "A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
\eccq
The rendered text in the current format \Verb!latex! becomes


\begin{quote}
As explained in
Section~\ref{subsec:ex}in \href{{http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html#subsec:ex}}{Langtangen, 2012}
\cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
\end{quote}


A reference to an entire external document, which is usually a chapter
if the reference is internal in the DocOnce source, applies the
\Verb!refch! syntax:

\bccq
As explained in
refch[Chapter ref{ch:testdoc}]["Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}][the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], DocOnce documents may include tables.
\eccq
The output now if \Verb!ch:testdoc! is not a label in the document,
becomes in the \Verb!latex! and \Verb!pdflatex! case

\bccq
As explained in
"Langtangen, 2012":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
\eccq
That is, the internal reference \Verb!Chapter ...! is omitted since
it is not meaningful to refer to an external document as "Chapter".
The resulting rendered text in the current format \Verb!latex! becomes


\begin{quote}
As explained in
\href{{http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/test/demo_testdoc.html}}{Langtangen, 2012}
\cite{testdoc:12}, DocOnce documents may include tables.
\end{quote}


Note that {\LaTeX} cannot
have links to local files, so a complete URL on the form
\Verb!http://...! must be used.

And here is another example with internal references only:

\bccq
Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][dummy1][
dummy2].
\eccq
The text is rendered to


\begin{quote}
Generalized references are described in

For this purpose, DocOnce offers *generalized references* which allows

the generalized references in DocOnce has a syntax that may utilize
the ``xr`` feature in LaTeX.

The syntax of generalized references reads

.. code-block:: text

        ref[internal][cite][external]

If all `:ref:`label`` references in the text ``internal`` are references
to labels in the present document, the above ``ref`` command is replaced
by the text ``internal``. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is ``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line ``#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal cite`` and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
When referring to a complete chapter (not a section in it), which
corresponds to a complete external document, it does not make sense
to write out ``internal cite`` since the ``internal`` reference is a
chapter number. In such cases, the ``internal`` syntax can be used,
and if the label is in another LaTeX document, the output is just ``cite``.
For all
output formats other than ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``, the ``external``
text will be the output.

Here is an example on a specific generalized reference to a section
in a document:

<p>
The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from DocOnce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

<h1 id="sec1">Section 1</h1>

    Here are two lines that make up

    also with hypens:
    <em>pre</em>-fix, post-<em>fix</em>, <b>pre</b>-fix, post-<b>fix</b>.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here are two references. Equation&nbsp;<a href="._testdoc002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a> is fine. Eq.&nbsp;<a href="._testdoc002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a> too.
Even Equation <a href="._testdoc002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a> without the tilde.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h2 id="subsec1">Subsection 1</h2>

<p>
<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
the section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the
the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="._testdoc002.html#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="._testdoc002.html#exer:some:formula">Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
 <a href="._testdoc002.html#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="._testdoc002.html#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<h3 id="___sec3">Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence </h3>

<p>
The section <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> is fine.
The section <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a> too.

<p>
<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

<h3 id="___sec4">Computer code </h3>

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>

<!-- code=fortran (!bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td><div class="linenodiv" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding-right: 10px"><pre style="line-height: 125%"> 1

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment

<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "perldoc" -->

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline

spellcheck, test <code>a verbatim expression</code> in <code>another</code> in a <code>third</code>.
Also test exclamation mark as in <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>a != b</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code>.

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third [<a id="link_footnote_5" href="#def_footnote_5">5</a>] example.

<p id="def_footnote_1"><a href="#link_footnote_1"><b>1:</b></a> Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_2"><a href="#link_footnote_2"><b>2:</b></a> Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_4"><a href="#link_footnote_4"><b>4:</b></a> <a href="google.com" target="_self"><tt>google.com</tt></a> is perhaps the most famous
web site today.</p>

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Non-breaking space character.</b>
<p>
This paragraph aims to test <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space" target="_self">non-breaking space character</a>, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4&nbsp;km is traveled
in&nbsp;\( 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345 \)&nbsp;s.  Also check that a&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">link</a>&nbsp;is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in <code>[~x for x in y]</code> or in <code>y=~x</code>, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)

<h2 id="decay:sec:theta">The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?)</h2>

<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}

<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0

\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}

<h2 id="___sec10">Custom Environments </h2>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<div id="theorem:fundamental1"></div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="left">time</th> <th align="left">velocity</th> <th align="left">acceleration</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0     </td> <td align="left">   1.4186      </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<p>
<table border="1">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

<p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">exact</th> <td align="center"><code>v_1</code></td> <td align="center">\( a_i \) + <code>v_2</code></td> <td align="center"><code>verb_3_</code></td> </tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

<p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><td align="center">   \( S \)   </td> <th align="center">        command         </th> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   \( x\cap y \)    </td> <td align="right">   <code>x|y</code>            </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Finally, a table with math
(<code>bm</code> that expands to <code>boldsymbol</code>, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

<p>
<!-- Mako code to expand URLs in the table -->
<!-- (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014) -->

Let us also add a test of quotes such as &quot;double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)&quot;; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that &quot;caused&quot; a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like <code>.txt</code>.

The example in the section <a href="#ex:test:1p1">Example 1: A test function</a> demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function <code>add</code> appears in

<h2 id="ex:test:1p1">Example 1: A test function</h2>

<h2 id="subsubsec:ex">URLs</h2>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_self"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_self"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \tag{4} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

<p>
More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

<h2 id="demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</h2>
<!-- keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation -->

<p>
<!-- Torture tests -->

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin \( N \) times.
Print out &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;head&quot; for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r &lt;= 0.5</code>.

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Draw an integer among \( \{1,2\} \) with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
<b>Answer.</b>
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number \( < 1/2 \), let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this \( N \) number of times.

<p>
<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->

<p>

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

<p>
Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Vectorize the code in a) using <code>numpy.sum</code>.

<p>
<!-- --- begin answer of exercise --- -->
<b>Answer.</b>
<code>np.sum(np.where(r &lt;= 0.5, 1, 0))</code> or <code>np.sum(r &lt;= 0.5)</code>.

<p>
<!-- --- end answer of exercise --- -->

<p>
In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.

<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>
At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

</ol>

<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

<h2 id="proj:circle1">Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles</h2>

<p>
The formula for a circle is given by

$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<b>Tip.</b>

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h2 id="___sec58">Appendix: Testing inline comments </h2>

<p>
<!-- Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+ -->

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the

 I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox.

<h2 id="___sec59">Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code> </h2>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
We also test mdash&mdash;used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

<p>
<blockquote>
    *Fun is fun.*&mdash; Unknown.
</blockquote>


<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from DocOnce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<h1 id="sec1">Section 1</h1>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<b>Here is a list with paragraph heading.</b>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec1">Here is a list with subsubsection heading </h3>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote for testing <em>emphasized words</em> and <b>boldface words</b>,
    also with hypens:
    <em>pre</em>-fix, post-<em>fix</em>, <b>pre</b>-fix, post-<b>fix</b>.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here are two references. Equation&nbsp;<b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b> is fine. Eq.&nbsp;<b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b> too.
Even Equation <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b> without the tilde.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h2 id="subsec1">Subsection 1</h2>

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
the section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the
the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="#exer:some:formula">Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
 <a href="#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<h3 id="___sec3">Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence </h3>

<p>
The section <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> is fine.
The section <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a> too.

<h3 id="___sec4">Computer code </h3>

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>
But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
<code>&lt;a href=&quot;</code> (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

<p>
And here is a system call:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; mkdir test
Terminal&gt; cd test
Terminal&gt; myprog -f
output1
output2
</pre></div>
<p>
Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
results in

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=======</span>
<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">Heading</span>
<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=======</span>

Some text.
</pre></div>
<p>
Finally, <code>!bc do</code> supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">======= DocOnce test file =======</span>

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">===== Computer code =====</span>

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example on a function.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">===== Mathematics =====</span>

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
<span style="color: #008000">\begin{align*}</span>
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= 0,\\ 
\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= \nabla\phi .
<span style="color: #008000">\end{align*}</span>
!et

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=== Subsubsection heading ===</span>

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

<span style="color: #800080; font-weight: bold">__Paragraph heading.__</span> Paragraphs may have headings.
</pre></div>
<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! For
spellcheck, test <code>a verbatim expression</code> in <code>another</code> in a <code>third</code>.
Also test exclamation mark as in <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>a != b</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak<br />
code.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when <code>html</code> <br />
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

<h3 id="___sec6">Running OS commands </h3>

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; python -c &#39;print &quot;Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython.&quot;&#39;

</pre></div>

<h3 id="___sec7">Footnotes </h3>

<p>
Here is a test of footnotes [<a id="link_footnote_1" href="#def_footnote_1">1</a>], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

<ul>
 <li> list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)</li>
 <li> even with math $latex \nabla^2u$ [<a id="link_footnote_2" href="#def_footnote_2">2</a>]</li>
 <li> and code <code>h[i] += 1</code> [<a id="link_footnote_3" href="#def_footnote_3">3</a>]
   (<em>must</em> have space between inline code and footnote!)</li>
 <li> and <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">links</a> [<a id="link_footnote_4" href="#def_footnote_4">4</a>]</li>
</ul>

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third [<a id="link_footnote_5" href="#def_footnote_5">5</a>] example.

<p id="def_footnote_1"><a href="#link_footnote_1"><b>1:</b></a> Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_2"><a href="#link_footnote_2"><b>2:</b></a> Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_3"><a href="#link_footnote_3"><b>3:</b></a> One-line footnote.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_4"><a href="#link_footnote_4"><b>4:</b></a> <a href="google.com" target="_blank"><tt>google.com</tt></a> is perhaps the most famous
web site today.</p>

<p>
Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Non-breaking space character.</b>
<p>
This paragraph aims to test <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space" target="_blank">non-breaking space character</a>, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4&nbsp;km is traveled
in&nbsp;$latex 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$&nbsp;s.  Also check that a&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">link</a>&nbsp;is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in <code>[~x for x in y]</code> or in <code>y=~x</code>, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
</div>


<h2 id="subsec:ex">Subsection 2: Testing figures</h2>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which

<h2 id="decay:sec:theta">The $latex \theta$ parameter (not $latex \nabla$?)</h2>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $latex \theta$:
<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on $latex \theta$.</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
$latex \frac{1}{2}$, $latex {1/2}$, $latex \pmb{x}$, $latex \frac{Du}{dt}$,
both inline and in block:

<p>

$latex 
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
 $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2} $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
 $

<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

<p>

$latex 
\frac{Du}{dt} = 0
 $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2} = {1/2} $

$latex  
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}

 $

<h2 id="___sec10">Custom Environments </h2>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>

<div id="theorem:fundamental1"></div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let $latex a=1$ and $latex b=2$. Then $latex c=3$.

<p>

<b>Proof.</b>
Since $latex c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$latex latex \Diamond$

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h2 id="subsec:table">Tables</h2>

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">time</th> <th align="center">velocity</th> <th align="center">acceleration</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0     </td> <td align="right">   1.4186      </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   2.0     </td> <td align="right">   1.376512    </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>

</table>
<p>
The DocOnce source code reads
<p>


<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="left">time</th> <th align="left">velocity</th> <th align="left">acceleration</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0     </td> <td align="left">   1.4186      </td> <td align="left">   -5.01           </td> </tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<h2 id="subsubsec:ex">URLs</h2>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_blank">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_blank">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_blank"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_blank"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_blank">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_blank">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_blank"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_blank"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_blank"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_blank"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

$latex  a = b + c  $


or with number and label, as in <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>, using the equation environment:

$latex 
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
 $


We can refer to this equation by <b>(REF to equation my:eq1 not supported)</b>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:

$latex 
\pmb{a} = \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n}  $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
 $

<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

$latex 
a = q + 4 + 5+ 6   $

$latex  
b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
 $


We can refer to <b>(REF to equation eq1 not supported)</b>-<b>(REF to equation eq2 not supported)</b>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test $latex a_{i-j}$ as well as $latex kx-wt$.

<h2 id="demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</h2>

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $latex N$ times.
Print out &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;head&quot; for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
Use <code>r = random.random()</code> and define head as <code>r &lt;= 0.5</code>.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Draw an integer among $latex \{1,2\}$ with
<code>r = random.randint(1,2)</code> and define head when <code>r</code> is 1.

<p>

<b>Answer.</b>
If the <code>random.random()</code> function returns a number $latex <1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $latex N$ number of times.

<b>b)</b>
Vectorize the code in a) using boolean indexing.

<p>
Vectorized code can be written in many ways.
Sometimes the code is less intuitive, sometimes not.

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Vectorize the code in a) using <code>numpy.sum</code>.

<p>

<b>Answer.</b>
<code>np.sum(np.where(r &lt;= 0.5, 1, 0))</code> or <code>np.sum(r &lt;= 0.5)</code>.

<p>
In this latter subexercise, we have an
example where the code is easy to read.

<h3 id="___sec34">My remarks </h3>

<p>

<h2 id="demo:ex:2">Project 4: Compute a Probability</h2>

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $latex [0,1)$?

<p>
At the end we have a list because that caused problems in LaTeX
in previous DocOnce versions:

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $latex N$ such random numbers using Python's standard <code>random</code> module,
count how many of them, $latex M$, that fall in the interval $latex (0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $latex M/N$.

<h2 id="proj:circle1">Project 5: Explore Distributions of Random Circles</h2>

The formula for a circle is given by

<p>

$latex

$latex

 $


where $latex R$ is the radius of the circle, $latex (x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $latex t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $latex [0,1]$.
For any $latex t$, $latex (x,y)$ is a point on the circle.

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
A hint for this subexercise.

<p>

Filename: <code>subexer_b.pdf</code>.

<p>

<b>Solution.</b>
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.

<p>

The text here belongs to the main (intro) part of the exercise. Need
closing remarks to have text after subexercises.

<p>
Test list in exercise:

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="___sec42">Remarks </h3>

<p>
Some final closing remarks, e.g., summarizing the main findings
and their implications in other problems can be made. These
remarks will appear at the end of the typeset exercise.

<h2 id="___sec43">Some exercise without the "Exercise:" prefix </h2>

<p>
Just some text. And some math saying that $latex e^0=1$ on a single line,
to test that math block insertion is correct:

<p>

$latex  \exp{(0)} = 1  $

<p>
And a test that the code <code>lambda x: x+2</code> is correctly placed here:

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">lambda x: x+2
</pre></div>

<h2 id="sec:this:exer:de">Exercise 8: Solution of differential equation</h2>

<p>

Given

<p>

$latex  \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1  $


What is the solution of this equation?

<p>

$latex y=e^{-y}$

<p>

$latex y=e^{y}$

<p>

Almost, but the sign is wrong (note the minus!).

<p>


<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">from</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">math</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> exp
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> exp(x)
</pre></div>
<p>

Ooops, forgot a minus: <code>exp(-x)</code>, otherwise this Python code
must be considered as a good answer. It is more natural,
though, to write the solution to the problem
in mathematical notation:

<p>

$latex  y(x) = e^{-y}. $

<p>

The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.

<p>

Equations with derivatives can be solved;
they are termed <em>differential
equations</em>.

<p>

The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for $latex x$ or $latex y$, not a function $latex y(x)$.

<p>

Equations where the unknown is a function, as $latex y(x)$
here, are called <em>differential equations</em>, and are solved by
special techniques.

<b>Tip.</b>

Here is a tip or hint box, typeset as a notice box.

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_blank">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h2 id="___sec58">Appendix: Testing inline comments </h2>

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. 

<font color="red">(<b>hpl's semi opinion 1</b>: not sure if in the cloud is understood by all.)</font>

 I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. 

<font color="red">(<b>mp 2</b>: Simply go to <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank"><tt>http://dropbox.com</tt></a> and watch the video. It explains how files, like <code>myfile.py</code>, perhaps containing much math, like $latex \partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.)</font>

 It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among  <font color="red">(<b>hpl 3</b>:)</font> <del> laptops and mobile units </del> <font color="red">computers, tablets, and phones</font>.

<h2 id="___sec59">Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code> </h2>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
We also test mdash&mdash;used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

<p>
<blockquote>
    *Fun is fun.*&mdash; Unknown.
</blockquote>


<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

<p id="def_footnote_5"><a href="#link_footnote_5"><b>5:</b></a> Not much to add here, but the footnote

<p>
The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from DocOnce).

<p>
<!-- Just a comment -->

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

<h1 id="sec1">Section 1</h1>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<b>Here is a list with paragraph heading.</b>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec1">Here is a list with subsubsection heading </h3>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote for testing <em>emphasized words</em> and <b>boldface words</b>,
    also with hypens:
    <em>pre</em>-fix, post-<em>fix</em>, <b>pre</b>-fix, post-<b>fix</b>.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here are two references. Equation&nbsp;\eqref{my:eq1} is fine. Eq.&nbsp;\eqref{my:eq1} too.
Even Equation \eqref{my:eq1} without the tilde.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h2 id="subsec1">Subsection 1</h2>

<p>
<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
the section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the
the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="#exer:some:formula">Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
 <a href="#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<h3 id="___sec3">Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence </h3>

<p>
The section <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> is fine.
The section <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a> too.

<p>
<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

<h3 id="___sec4">Computer code </h3>

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>

<!-- code=fortran (!bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span>test()

      r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0</span>

      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">end do</span>

      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
and then just the subroutine,
<p>

<!-- code=fortran (!bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span>test()

      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">end do</span>
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">      return</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(<code>envir=ccq</code>):
<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">C     a comment

      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Testing other code environments. First Python:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
which gets rendered as

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x<span style="color: #666666">+1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

<p>
<b>Paragraph heading before code.</b>

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">sys</span>

<p>
But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
<code>&lt;a href=&quot;</code> (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

<p>
And here is a system call:

<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; mkdir test
Terminal&gt; cd test
Terminal&gt; myprog -f

output2
</pre></div>
<p>
Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc restructuredtext
=======

!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
results in

<p>

<!-- code=restructuredtext (!bc restructuredtext) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=======</span>
<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">Heading</span>

Some text.
</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- Here goes hidden code. -->
<!-- Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out. -->

<p>
Finally, <code>!bc do</code> supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

<p>

<!-- code=doconce (!bc do) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">======= DocOnce test file =======</span>

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">===== Computer code =====</span>

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example on a function.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">===== Mathematics =====</span>

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

<span style="color: #008000">\begin{align*}</span>
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= 0,\\ 
\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= \nabla\phi .
<span style="color: #008000">\end{align*}</span>
!et

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=== Subsubsection heading ===</span>

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

<span style="color: #800080; font-weight: bold">__Paragraph heading.__</span> Paragraphs may have headings.
</pre></div>
<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! For
spellcheck, test <code>a verbatim expression</code> in <code>another</code> in a <code>third</code>.
Also test exclamation mark as in <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>a != b</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak<br />
code.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when <code>html</code> <br />
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

<h3 id="___sec6">Running OS commands </h3>

<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; python -c &#39;print &quot;Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython.&quot;&#39;

</pre></div>

<h3 id="___sec7">Footnotes </h3>

<p>
Here is a test of footnotes [<a id="link_footnote_1" href="#def_footnote_1">1</a>], which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

<ul>
 <li> list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)</li>
 <li> even with math \( \nabla^2u \) [<a id="link_footnote_2" href="#def_footnote_2">2</a>]</li>
 <li> and code <code>h[i] += 1</code> [<a id="link_footnote_3" href="#def_footnote_3">3</a>]
   (<em>must</em> have space between inline code and footnote!)</li>
 <li> and <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">links</a> [<a id="link_footnote_4" href="#def_footnote_4">4</a>]</li>
</ul>

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third [<a id="link_footnote_5" href="#def_footnote_5">5</a>] example.

<p id="def_footnote_1"><a href="#link_footnote_1"><b>1:</b></a> Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_2"><a href="#link_footnote_2"><b>2:</b></a> Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_3"><a href="#link_footnote_3"><b>3:</b></a> One-line footnote.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_4"><a href="#link_footnote_4"><b>4:</b></a> <a href="google.com" target="_self"><tt>google.com</tt></a> is perhaps the most famous
web site today.</p>

<p>
Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Non-breaking space character.</b>
<p>
This paragraph aims to test <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space" target="_self">non-breaking space character</a>, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4&nbsp;km is traveled
in&nbsp;\( 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345 \)&nbsp;s.  Also check that a&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">link</a>&nbsp;is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in <code>[~x for x in y]</code> or in <code>y=~x</code>, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
</div>


<h2 id="subsec:ex">Subsection 2: Testing figures</h2>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Visualization of a wave. <div id="fig:impact"></div> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p>
</center>

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <div id="myfig"></div> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>
</center>

<p>
<!-- Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem -->

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h2 id="decay:sec:theta">The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?)</h2>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}
$$

<h2 id="___sec10">Custom Environments </h2>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<div id="theorem:fundamental1"></div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h2 id="subsec:table">Tables</h2>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">time</th> <th align="center">velocity</th> <th align="center">acceleration</th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   0.0     </td> <td align="right">   1.4186      </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
The DocOnce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>
<table border="1">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<p>
<table border="1">

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with <code>|-</code> because of a negative number,
and <code>|</code> right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or

too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a

fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_self"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and

The formula for a circle is given by

$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

<p>
Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/" target="_self">Script for Introduction to Version Control</a> provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

<p>
Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

<p>
The simplest services for hosting project files are <a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_self">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_self">Google Drive</a>.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

<p>
More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

<p>
The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

<p>
All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.

<h2 id="___sec58">Appendix: Testing inline comments </h2>

<p>
<!-- Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+ -->

workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the

 I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious

<h2 id="___sec59">Appendix: Testing headings ending with <code>verbatim inline</code> </h2>

<p>
The point here is to test 1) <code>verbatim</code> code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in LaTeX.

<p>
We also test mdash&mdash;used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:

<p>
<blockquote>
    *Fun is fun.*&mdash; Unknown.
</blockquote>


<p>
And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: <code>admon.do.txt</code>.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade {\LaTeX} (from DocOnce).

% Just a comment

\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Section 1}
\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with paragraph heading.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\paragraph{Here is a list with subsubsection heading.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{quote}
Here are two lines that make up
a block quote for testing \emph{emphasized words} and \textbf{boldface words},
also with hypens:
\emph{pre}-fix, post-\emph{fix}, \textbf{pre}-fix, post-\textbf{fix}.
\end{quote}


Here are two references. Equation~(\ref{my:eq1}) is fine. Eq.~(\ref{my:eq1}) too.
Even Equation (\ref{my:eq1}) without the tilde.


\paragraph{Subsection 1.}
\label{subsec1}

\index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

% Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line
% and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
Section~\ref{sec1} and~\ref{subsec1}, and further to the
sections~\ref{subsec1} and~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, which
encourages you to do the tasks in the
Exercises~\ref{demo:ex:1} and~\ref{exer:some:formula}.
Appendices~\ref{app1} and~\ref{app2} are also nice elements.

\paragraph{Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence.}
Section~\ref{subsec1} is fine.
Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex} too.


% sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

\paragraph{Computer code.}
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(\Verb!envir=ccq!):
\bccq
C     a comment

      subroutine test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\eccq

Testing other code environments. First Python:

\bccq
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
\eccq
which gets rendered as

\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

\paragraph{Paragraph heading before code.}

\bpycod
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
\epycod

\paragraph{Subsubsection heading before code.}
\bpycod
def h(z):
    return z+1
\epycod

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

\bpypro
class Line:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a, self.b = a, b

    def __call__(self, x):
        a, b = self.a, self.b
        return a*x + b

line = Line(2, 1)
y = line(x=3)
print y
\epypro
\noindent
(\href{{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=class+Line\%3A\%0A++++def+__init__\%28self\%2C+a\%2C+b\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++self.a\%2C+self.b+\%3D+a\%2C+b\%0A\%0A++++def+__call__\%28self\%2C+x\%29\%3A\%0A++++++++a\%2C+b+\%3D+self.a\%2C+self.b\%0A++++++++return+a\%2Ax+\%2B+b\%0A\%0Aline+\%3D+Line\%282\%2C+1\%29\%0Ay+\%3D+line\%28x\%3D3\%29\%0Aprint+y&mode=display&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=false&drawParentPointers=false&textReferences=false&py=2&curInstr=0}}{Visualize execution}) 


Some more Python code (actually specified as a sage cell, but
such cells are not supported by this format).

\bpypro
a = 2
b = 3
print 'a+b:', a + b

# In a sage cell we can also plot
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
from numpy import *
x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
plot(x, y)
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
show()
\epypro


Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

Standard Python shell sessions:

\bpyshell
>>> from numpy import sin
>>> # Some comment
>>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\epyshell

IPython sessions:

\bipy
In [1]: from numpy import sin

In [2]: # Some comment

In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
Value: 0.932039085967
\eipy


% This one tests a + sign before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
% The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)
% It also tests emoji before code
And a little bit of Fortran: (\Verb!dizzy_face!)

\bccq
!bc cod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
!ec
\eccq
which then is typeset as

\bcod
      subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
      real*8 a, b, x
      x = (a + b)/2
      length = b - a
      return
      end
\ecod

HTML:

\bhtmlcod
<table>
<tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
<!-- comment -->
</table>
\ehtmlcod

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
\Verb!<a href="! (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

\bccq
!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
!ec
\eccq
results in

\brestructuredtext
=======
Heading
=======

Some text.
\erestructuredtext

% Here goes hidden code.
% Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.





Finally, \Verb?!bc do? supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

\bdo
======= DocOnce test file =======

===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\ 
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et

=== Subsubsection heading ===

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

__Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.
\edo

It is time to test \Verb!verbatim inline font! especially with \Verb!a newline inside the text! and an exclamation mark at the end: \Verb!BEGIN!! For
spellcheck, test \Verb!a verbatim expression! in \Verb!another! in a \Verb!third!.
Also test exclamation mark as in \Verb?!bc? and \Verb?!ec? as well as \Verb?a != b?.
Also test backslashes and braces like \Verb!\begin!, \Verb!\begin{enumerate}!,
\Verb!\end{this}\end{that}!, and \Verb!{something \inside braces}!.

Here is some \textcolor{red}{red color} and an attempt to write \textcolor{green}{with
green color containing a linebreak\\
code.} Some formats will only display \\
this correctly when \Verb!html! \\
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

\paragraph{Running OS commands.}
\bsys
Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
Testing
output
from
Python.
\esys


\paragraph{Footnotes.}
Here is a test of footnotes \footnote{Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format. Plain text does nothing, {\LaTeX} removes the definition and inserts the footnote as part of the {\LaTeX} text. reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.}, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

\begin{itemize}
 \item list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 \item even with math $\nabla^2u$\footnote{Math footnotes can be dangerous since it interferes with an exponent.}

 \item and code \Verb!h[i] += 1!\footnote{One-line footnote.}
   (\emph{must} have space between inline code and footnote!)

 \item and \href{{http://google.com}}{links}\footnote{\href{{google.com}}{\nolinkurl{google.com}} is perhaps the most famous web site today.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third\footnote{Not much to add here, but the footnote is at the end with only one newline.} example.





Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Non-breaking space character.]
This paragraph aims to test \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space}}{non-breaking space character}, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4~km is traveled
in~$7.4/5.5\approx 1.345$~s.  Also check that a~\href{{http://google.com}}{link}~is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in \Verb![~x for x in y]! or in \Verb!y=~x!, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{Subsection 2: Testing figures.}
\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
  \caption{
  Visualization of a wave. \label{fig:impact}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}



\index{movies}


% Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.eps}}
  \caption{
  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v1! and \protect \Verb!my\_file\_v2! as well as math with subscript as in $t_{i+1}$. \label{myfig}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{downloaded_figures/f_plot.png}}




% Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs


\paragraph{Remark.}
Movies are tested in separate file \Verb!movies.do.txt!.


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\paragraph{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?).}
\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\bccq
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\eccq

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this \report:
$\half$, $\halfi$, $\x$, $\Ddt{u}$,
both inline and in block:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

Or with align with label and numbers:

\begin{align}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\label{aligneq1}\\ 
\half &= \halfi\\ 
\half\x &= \normalvec
\label{aligneq2}
\end{align}


\paragraph{Custom Environments.}
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \Verb!.tex! by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


\paragraph{Tables.}
\label{subsec:table}

\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}
\index{test two@test {\rm\texttt{two}} (separate) {\rm\texttt{verbatim expressions}} which is also possible}
\index{index with!subindex}

% index with comma could fool sphinx
\index{index, with comma, and one more}

Let us take this table from the manual:

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}



\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
2.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
4.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The DocOnce source code reads
\bccq

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

\eccq

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{l}{ time } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ velocity } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ acceleration } \\
\hline
0.0  & 1.4186   & -5.01        \\
1.0  & 1.376512 & 11.919       \\
3.0  & 1.1E+1   & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ $i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $h_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ $\bar T_i$ } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ \Verb!L\_i! } \\
\hline
0   & 0      & 288        & -0.0065    \\
1   & 11,000 & 216        & 0.0        \\
2   & 20,000 & 216        & 0.001      \\
3   & 32,000 & 228        & 0.0028     \\
4   & 47,000 & 270        & 0.0        \\
5   & 51,000 & 270        & -0.0028    \\

\paragraph{Quotes.}
Let us also add a test of quotes such as ``double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)''; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct {\LaTeX} formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that ``caused'' a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like \Verb!.txt!.


\paragraph{Bibliography test.}
Here is an example: \cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002} discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, \cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002} gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in \cite{Langtangen_1994a}.
The book chapter \cite{Mardal_et_al_2003a} contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is \cite{Langtangen_1988d} about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
\cite{Langtangen_Pedersen_2002,Mardal_et_al_2003a}.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
\cite{Langtangen_1992c,Langtangen_1994a,Mortensen_et_al_2011,Langtangen_Pedersen_2002}
and
\cite{Langtangen_et_al_2002,Glimsdal_et_al_20006,Rahman_et_al_2006b,Haga_et_al_2011a,Langtangen_2003a,Langtangen_2008a,Langtangen:95}
and all the work of
\cite{Langtangen_2012,Mardal_et_al_2003a,Jeberg_et_al_2004} as well as
old work \cite{Langtangen_1988d} and \cite{Langtangen_1989e}, and the
talk \cite{Langtangen_talk_2007a}.
Langtangen also had two thesis \cite{Langtangen:85,Langtangen_1989e}.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book \cite{Langtangen:91} and the
\cite{Langtangen:94b} OONSKI '94 paper.

\subsection*{Example \thedoconceexercisecounter: Examples can be typeset as exercises}

\label{Example}

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with \Verb!Example:!
and then, with the command-line option \Verb!--examples_as_exercises! be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

\end{doconceexercise}
% --- end exercise ---


\paragraph{User-defined environments.}
Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1} demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function \Verb!add! appears in
Example~\ref{ex:test:1p1}.


\begin{example}
\label{ex:test:1p1}

\noindent\emph{A test function}.

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

\bpycod
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    a = 1; b = 1
    expected = a + b
    computed = add(a, b)
    assert expected == computed
\epycod
\end{example}



\begin{example}
\label{ex:math:1p1}

\noindent\emph{Addition}.

We have

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]
\end{example}



\begin{tcolorbox}[%skin=widget,
boxrule=1mm,
coltitle=black,
colframe=blue!45!white,
colback=blue!15!white,
width=(.9\linewidth),before=\hfill,after=\hfill,
adjusted title={Highlight box!}]
This environment is used to highlight something:

\[ E = mc^2 \]
\end{tcolorbox}



\paragraph{URLs.}
\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}, or
the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.  Here is a
plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or
\href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link with
newline}. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. Also \Verb!file:///! works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html}}{link to a
file} is
fine to have. Moreover, ``loose'' URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{hpl@simula.no}}, or just a \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{mail link}, or a raw \href{{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}{\nolinkurl{mailto:hpl@simula.no}}.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the \Verb!latex! format:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{Newton-Cotes} formulas
and a \href{{http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1}}{good book}. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
\href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%E2\%80\%93Cotes_formulas}}
and \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}}{\nolinkurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes\#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae}} which has a shebang.

For the \Verb!--device=paper! option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the \Verb!--latex_no_program_footnotelink!
is used), as in this reference to
\href{{https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py}}{\nolinkurl{decay_mod}}, \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball1.py}},
and \href{{http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py}}{\nolinkurl{ball2.py}}.


% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst
% format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

% Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,
% if rst output is desired, but placed in a \Verb!_static*! folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
\Verb!--device=paper! option must be correct. We have
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, \href{{http://google.com}}{google}, and
\href{{http://google.com}}{google}, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.



\paragraph{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes.}
Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example, and 1 vs.~2 which is also often used.
Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen, or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A reference like Sec.~\ref{subsubsec:ex} or
Ch.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, or even App.~\ref{subsubsec:ex}, must also be
handled. Likewise, this is test no.~$i$ of DocOnce features.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.
Percentage must be fixed: 7\%,  87.65\% and
50\% at the beginning of the line.


% !split and check if these extra words are included properly in the comment

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}). They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test {\LaTeX} hyphen in \Verb!CG-2!.
Also test $a_{i-j}$ as well as $kx-wt$.

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have Problem~\ref{demo:ex:1} and Project~\ref{demo:ex:2},
as well as Projects~\ref{proj:circle1} and~\ref{exer:you}, and in
between there we have Exercise~\ref{exer:some:formula}.

\subsection*{Project \thedoconceexercisecounter: Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by

\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \Verb!n! points on a circle:

\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \Verb!circle! function

Need a lot of text to surround the summary box.
Version control systems allow you to record the history of files
and share files among several computers and collaborators in a
professional way. File changes on one computer are updated or
merged with changes on another computer. Especially when working
with programs or technical reports it is essential
to have changes documented and to
ensure that every computer and person involved in the project
have the latest updates of the files.
Greg Wilson' excellent \href{{http://software-carpentry.org/2010/07/script-for-introduction-to-version-control/}}{Script for Introduction to Version Control} provides a more detailed motivation why you will benefit greatly
from using version control systems.

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that site. I strongly
recommend you to use such sites for all serious programming and
scientific writing work - and all other important files.

The simplest services for hosting project files are \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{Dropbox} and \href{{http://drive.google.com}}{Google Drive}.
It is very easy to get started with these systems, and they allow you
to share files among laptops and mobile units with as many users as
you want. The systems offer a kind of version control in that the
files are stored frequently (several times per minute), and you can go
back to previous versions for the last 30 days. However, it is
challenging  to find the right version from the past when there are
so many of them.

More seriously, when several people may edit files simultaneously, it
can be difficult detect who did what when, roll back to previous
versions, and to manually merge the edits when these are
incompatible. Then one needs more sophisticated tools than Dropbox or
Google Drive: project hosting services with true version control
systems.  The following text aims at providing you with the minimum
information to started with such systems. Numerous other tutorials
contain more comprehensive material and in-depth explanations of the
concepts and tools.

The idea with project hosting services is that you have the files
associated with a project in the cloud. Many people may share these
files.  Every time you want to work on the project you explicitly
update your version of the files, edit the files as you like, and
synchronize the files with the "master version" at the site where the
project is hosted.  If you at some point need to go back to a
version of the files at some particular point in the past,
this is an easy operation. You can also use tools to see
what various people have done with the files in the various versions.

All these services are very similar. Below we describe how you get
started with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Googlecode. Launchpad works very
similarly to the latter three. All the project hosting services have
excellent introductions available at their web sites, but the recipes
below are much shorter and aim at getting you started as quickly as
possible by concentrating on the most important need-to-know steps.
The Git tutorials we refer to later in this document contain more
detailed information and constitute of course very valuable readings
when you use version control systems every day. The point now is
to get started.


\paragraph{Appendix: Testing inline comments.}
% Names can be [ A-Za-z0-9_'+-]+

Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. \shortinlinecomment{hpl's semi opinion 1}{ not sure if in the cloud is understood by all. }{ not sure if in } I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. \longinlinecomment{mp 2}{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} and watch the video. It explains how files, like \Verb!myfile.py!, perhaps containing much math, like $\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines. }{ Simply go to \href{{http://dropbox.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://dropbox.com}} } It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among \textcolor{red}{(hpl 3:)} \replace{laptops and mobile units}{computers, tablets, and phones}.

$Q>0$, because (\textbf{edit 6}:) \remove{a} negative \textcolor{red}{(edit 7:)} \replace{quantity is}{quantities are} (\textbf{edit 8}:) \remove{just} negative.  \textcolor{red}{ (\textbf{edit 9}:) This comes as no surprise.}

\paragraph{Appendix: Testing headings ending with \protect\Verb!verbatim inline!.}
The point here is to test 1) \Verb!verbatim! code in headings, and 2)
ending a heading with verbatim code as this triggers a special
case in {\LaTeX}.

We also test mdash---used as alternative to hyphen without spaces around,
or in quotes:


\begin{quote}
\emph{Fun is fun.}--- Unknown.
\end{quote}


And finally, what about admons, quotes, and boxes? They are tested
in a separate document: \Verb!admon.do.txt!.

TITLE: How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
AUTHOR: HPL
DATE: today


This document is translated to the format _${FORMAT}_. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

__Test 1: Inline math.__ Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

__Test 2: A single equation without label.__ Here it is

!bt
\[ u(t)=e^{-at} \]
!et

__Test 3: A single equation with label.__ Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

!bc
|bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looking like

!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
and as a three-line latex code:

!bc
|bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
|et
!ec
looking like

!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
This equation has label (ref{eq1b}).


__Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.__ Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et

__Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.__ We use align with
labels:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} label{eq2b}\\
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2b})-(ref{eq3b}).

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but DocOnce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is

!bc rst
.. math::
   :label: eq2b

        u(t)=e^{-at}


.. math::
   :label: eq3b

        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}

!ec
# #endif

# #if FORMAT == "pandoc"
Original Pandoc-extended Markdown transformed to HTML via Pandoc
does not work with labels and multiple equations. `doconce md2html`
fixes the trouble by adding full support for MathJax and avoiding
that eqref references become empty.

One can write with align and labels in the DocOnce document and get excellent
output in LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, and Markdown-based HTML. Without
`doconce md2html` one must accept that labeles have very limited support
compared to more advanced MathJax.
# #endif


__Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.__ Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

!bc
|bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

__Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.__ We use eqnarray with
labels:

!bc
|bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
|et
!ec
and results in

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} label{eq2c}\\
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (ref{eq2c})-(ref{eq3c})?
# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
No, unfortunately not.
Note: DocOnce takes the eqnarray with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code

!bc rst
.. math::

        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\
        v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
!ec
That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.
# #endif

__Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.__
We have

!bt
\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using `\bm`:

!bt
\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
!et
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

# #if FORMAT in ("html", "sphinx", "pandoc", "ipynb")

% How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
% **HPL**
% Jan 32, 2100

This document is translated to the format **pandoc**. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

*Test 1: Inline math.* Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

*Test 2: A single equation without label.* Here it is

$$
 u(t)=e^{-at} 
$$

*Test 3: A single equation with label.* Here it is as a one-line
latex code,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

looking like

$$
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
$$
and as a three-line latex code:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

looking like

$$
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
$$
This equation has label \eqref{eq1b}.


*Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.* Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and results in

$$

u(t)=e^{-at}

$$

$$
  
v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}

$$

*Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.* We use align with
labels:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
\label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and results in

$$
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}  
v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2b}-\eqref{eq3b}.

\label{eq2c}\\

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
Can we refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2c}-\eqref{eq3c}?

*Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.*
We have

$$
 \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = \nu\nabla^2\pmb{u} -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,
$$
and $\nabla\pmb{u} (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n}$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using `\bm`:

$$
 \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} = \nu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,
$$
and $\nabla\boldsymbol{u} (\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\boldsymbol{n}$.

Note: for the pandoc format, `\bm` was substituted by DocOnce
to `\boldsymbol`.

This document is translated to the format <b>html</b>. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

<p>
<b>Test 1: Inline math.</b>
Here is a sentence contains the equation \( u(t)=e^{-at} \).

<p>
<b>Test 2: A single equation without label.</b>
Here it is

$$ u(t)=e^{-at} $$

<p>
<b>Test 3: A single equation with label.</b>
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bt

<p>
looking like

$$
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
$$

and as a three-line latex code:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->

</pre></div>
<p>
looking like

$$
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
$$

This equation has label \eqref{eq1b}.

<p>
<b>Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.</b>
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->

and results in

$$
\begin{align*}

$$
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}

$$

We can refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2b}-\eqref{eq3b}.

\end{eqnarray}
$$

Can we refer to the last equations as the system \eqref{eq2c}-\eqref{eq3c}?

<p>
<b>Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.</b>
We have

$$ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,$$

and \( \nabla\u (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n} \)

This document is translated to the format \textbf{pdflatex}. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

\paragraph{Test 1: Inline math.}
Here is a sentence contains the equation $u(t)=e^{-at}$.

\paragraph{Test 2: A single equation without label.}
Here it is

\[ u(t)=e^{-at} \]

\paragraph{Test 3: A single equation with label.}
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

\bccq
!bt
\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
!et
\eccq
looking like

\begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1}\end{equation}
and as a three-line latex code:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
!et
\eccq
looking like

\begin{equation}
u(t)=e^{-at} \label{eq1b}
\end{equation}
This equation has label (\ref{eq1b}).


\paragraph{Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.}
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than {\LaTeX} for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{align*}
u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.}
We use align with
labels:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at}
label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3b}
\end{align}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{align}
u(t)&=e^{-at} \label{eq2b}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3b}
\end{align}
We can refer to the last equations as the system (\ref{eq2b})-(\ref{eq3b}).




\paragraph{Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.}
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

\bccq
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{eqnarray*}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.}
We use eqnarray with
labels:

\bccq
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at}
label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
\eccq
and results in

\begin{eqnarray}
u(t)&=& e^{-at} \label{eq2c}\\ 
v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt} \label{eq3c}
\end{eqnarray}
Can we refer to the last equations as the system (\ref{eq2c})-(\ref{eq3c})?

\paragraph{Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.}
We have

\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\u = \nu\nabla^2\u -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
and $\nabla\u (\x)\cdot\normalvec$
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using \Verb!\bm!:

\[ \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\ubm}{\partial t}} +
\nabla\cdot\nabla\ubm = \nu\nabla^2\ubm -
\frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,\]
and $\nabla\ubm (\xbm)\cdot\normalvecbm$.

.. Document title:

How various formats can deal with LaTeX math
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Authors: HPL
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

This document is translated to the format **sphinx**. The purpose is to
test math and doconce and various output formats.

**Test 1: Inline math.**
Here is a sentence contains the equation :math:`u(t)=e^{-at}`.

**Test 2: A single equation without label.**
Here it is

.. math::
         u(t)=e^{-at} 

**Test 3: A single equation with label.**
Here it is as a one-line
latex code,

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{equation} u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1}\end{equation}
        !et

looking like

.. math::
   :label: eq1
         u(t)=e^{-at} 

and as a three-line latex code:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{equation}
        u(t)=e^{-at} label{eq1b}
        \end{equation}
        !et

looking like

.. math::
   :label: eq1b
        
        u(t)=e^{-at} 
        

This equation has label :eq:`eq1b`.

**Test 4: Multiple, aligned equations without label.**
Only the align
environment is supported by other formats than LaTeX for typesetting
multiple, aligned equations. The code reads

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        \end{align*}
        !et

and results in

.. math::
        
        u(t)&=e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        

**Test 5: Multiple, aligned equations with label.**
We use align with
labels:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{align}
        u(t)&=e^{-at}
        label{eq2b}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &= \frac{du}{dt}
        label{eq3b}
        \end{align}
        !et

and results in

.. math::
   :label: eq2b
        
        u(t)=e^{-at} 
        

.. math::
   :label: eq3b
          
        v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt} 
        

We can refer to the last equations as the system :eq:`eq2b`-:eq:`eq3b`.

Actually, *Sphinx does not support the align environment with labels*,
such as we write above,
but DocOnce splits in this case the equations into separate, single equations
with labels. Hence the user can write one code with align and labels
and have to work in LaTeX, HTML, and Sphinx. The generated Sphinx code
in the present case is

.. code-block:: rst

        .. math::
           :label: eq2b
        
                u(t)=e^{-at}
        
        
        .. math::
           :label: eq3b
        
                v(t) - 1 = \frac{du}{dt}
        

**Test 6: Multiple, aligned eqnarray equations without label.**
Let us
try the old eqnarray environment.

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{eqnarray*}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
        \end{eqnarray*}
        !et

and results in

.. math::
        
        u(t) &=  e^{-at}\\ 
        v(t) - 1  &=  \frac{du}{dt}
        

**Test 7: Multiple, eqnarrayed equations with label.**
We use eqnarray with
labels:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{eqnarray}
        u(t)&=& e^{-at}
        label{eq2c}\\ 
        v(t) - 1 &=& \frac{du}{dt}
        label{eq3c}
        \end{eqnarray}
        !et

and results in

.. math::
        
        u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\ 
        v(t) - 1  &=  \frac{du}{dt} 
        

Can we refer to the last equations as the system :eq:`eq2c`-:eq:`eq3c`?
No, unfortunately not.
Note: DocOnce takes the eqnarray with labels and replaces it automatically
by the Sphinx code

.. code-block:: rst

        .. math::
        
                u(t) &=  e^{-at} \\ 
                v(t)  &=  \frac{du}{dt}

That is why the equation numbers are gone and that eqnarray seemingly
works. MathJax does not support eqnarray with labels so Sphinx would
probably fail to show them (unless one tries PNG images or other
math engines?). The rule of thumb is to avoid equarray.

**Test 8: newcommands and boldface bm vs pmb.**
We have

.. math::
         \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t}} +
        \nabla\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = \nu\nabla^2\pmb{u} -
        \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,

and :math:`\nabla\pmb{u} (\pmb{x})\cdot\pmb{n}`
with plain old pmb. Here are the same formulas using ``\bm``:

.. math::
         \color{blue}{\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}} +
        \nabla\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} = \nu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} -
        \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p,

and :math:`\nabla\boldsymbol{u} (\boldsymbol{x})\cdot\boldsymbol{n}`.

Note: for the sphinx format, ``\bm`` was substituted by DocOnce
to ``\boldsymbol``.

<!-- !split -->

<p>
The format of this document is
plain, homemade HTML (from DocOnce).

<p>
<b>Abstract.</b> This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

<p>
And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<p>
<!-- Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!-- is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->

<h1 id="sec1">Section 1</h1>

<p>
Here is a nested list:

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
  <li> item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature</li>
  <li> and a sublist</li>

<ul>
    <li> with indented subitem1</li>
    <li> and a subitem2</li>
</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist</li>

<ol>
   <li> first item</li>
   <li> second item,
      continuing on a new line</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<b>Here is a list with paragraph heading.</b>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec1">Here is a list with subsubsection heading </h3>

<ul>
  <li> item1</li>
  <li> item2</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote for testing <em>emphasized words</em> and <b>boldface words</b>,
    also with hypens:
    <em>pre</em>-fix, post-<em>fix</em>, <b>pre</b>-fix, post-<b>fix</b>.
</blockquote>


<p>
Here are two references. Equation&nbsp;<a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a> is fine. Eq.&nbsp;<a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a> too.
Even Equation <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a> without the tilde.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

<h2 id="subsec1">Subsection 1</h2>

<p>
<!-- Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line -->
<!-- and other special fix situations for HTML. -->

<p>
More text, with a reference back to
the section <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> and <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a>, and further to the
the sections <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> and <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a>, which
encourages you to do the tasks in <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#demo:ex:1">Problem 2: Flip a Coin</a> and <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#exer:some:formula">Exercise 10: Make references to projects and problems</a>.
 <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#app1">Appendix: Just for testing; part I</a> and <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#app2">Appendix: Just for testing; part II</a> are also nice elements.

<h3 id="___sec3">Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence </h3>

<p>
The section <a href="#subsec1">Subsection 1</a> is fine.
The section <a href="#subsubsec:ex">URLs</a> too.

<p>
<!-- sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console -->

<h3 id="___sec4">Computer code </h3>

<p>
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<p>

<!-- code=fortran (!bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span>test()

      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
and then just the subroutine,
<p>

<!-- code=fortran (!bc fcod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">subroutine </span>test()

      <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">end do</span>
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">      return</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(<code>envir=ccq</code>):
<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">C     a comment

      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Testing other code environments. First Python:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc pycod

<p>
But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
<code>&lt;a href=&quot;</code> (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

<p>
And here is a system call:

<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; mkdir test
Terminal&gt; cd test

</pre></div>
<p>
Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">!bc restructuredtext
=======
Heading

Some text.
!ec
</pre></div>
<p>
results in

<p>

<!-- code=restructuredtext (!bc restructuredtext) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=======</span>
<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">Heading</span>
<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=======</span>

Some text.
</pre></div>
<p>
<!-- Here goes hidden code. -->
<!-- Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out. -->

<p>
Finally, <code>!bc do</code> supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

<p>

<!-- code=doconce (!bc do) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">======= DocOnce test file =======</span>

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">===== Computer code =====</span>

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example on a function.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec


<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">===== Mathematics =====</span>

<span style="color: #008000">\begin{align*}</span>
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= 0,\\ 
\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= \nabla\phi .
<span style="color: #008000">\end{align*}</span>
!et

<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">=== Subsubsection heading ===</span>

DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

<span style="color: #800080; font-weight: bold">__Paragraph heading.__</span> Paragraphs may have headings.
</pre></div>
<p>
It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! For
spellcheck, test <code>a verbatim expression</code> in <code>another</code> in a <code>third</code>.
Also test exclamation mark as in <code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> as well as <code>a != b</code>.
Also test backslashes and braces like <code>\begin</code>, <code>\begin{enumerate}</code>,
<code>\end{this}\end{that}</code>, and <code>{something \inside braces}</code>.

<p>
Here is some <font color="red">red color</font> and an attempt to write <font color="green">with
green color containing a linebreak<br />
code.</font> Some formats will only display <br />
this correctly when <code>html</code> <br />
is the output format.
But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

<h3 id="___sec7">Footnotes </h3>

<p>
Here is a test of footnotes <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" rel="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format. Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text. reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same syntax, just displayed properly in HTML."><a href="#def_footnote_1" id="link_footnote_1" style="color: white">1</a></button>, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

<ul>
 <li> list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)</li>
 <li> even with math \( \nabla^2u \) <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" rel="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Math footnotes can be dangerous since it interferes with an exponent."><a href="#def_footnote_2" id="link_footnote_2" style="color: white">2</a></button></li>
 <li> and code <code>h[i] += 1</code> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" rel="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="One-line footnote."><a href="#def_footnote_3" id="link_footnote_3" style="color: white">3</a></button>

 <li> and <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">links</a> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" rel="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="google.com is perhaps the most famous web site today."><a href="#def_footnote_4" id="link_footnote_4" style="color: white">4</a></button></li>
</ul>

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" rel="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Not much to add here, but the footnote is at the end with only one newline."><a href="._testdoc_vagrant003.html#def_footnote_5" id="link_footnote_5" style="color: white">5</a></button> example.

<p id="def_footnote_1"><a href="#link_footnote_1"><b>1:</b></a> Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.

syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_2"><a href="#link_footnote_2"><b>2:</b></a> Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
interferes with an exponent.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_3"><a href="#link_footnote_3"><b>3:</b></a> One-line footnote.</p>

<p id="def_footnote_4"><a href="#link_footnote_4"><b>4:</b></a> <a href="google.com" target="_self"><tt>google.com</tt></a> is perhaps the most famous
web site today.</p>

<p>
Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b>Non-breaking space character.</b>
This paragraph aims to test <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space" target="_self">non-breaking space character</a>, and a typical
example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4&nbsp;km is traveled
in&nbsp;\( 7.4/5.5\approx 1.345 \)&nbsp;s.  Also check that a&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">link</a>&nbsp;is
not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
(On the other hand, the tilde is used in
computer code, e.g., as in <code>[~x for x in y]</code> or in <code>y=~x</code>, and should
of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)

<h2 id="subsec:ex">Subsection 2: Testing figures</h2>

<p>
Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure <a href="#fig:impact">1</a> in which
there is a flow.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->

<p>
Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=200></p></center>

<p>
<!-- Test multi-line caption in figure -->

<p>
Here is figure <a href="#myfig">2</a> with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

<p>
<center> <!-- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like <code>my_file_v1</code> and <code>my_file_v2</code> as well as math with subscript as in \( t_{i+1} \). <div id="myfig"></div> </p></center>
<p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=500></p>

<p>
<!-- Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Movies are tested in separate file <code>movies.do.txt</code>.

<p>
<!-- Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis -->

<h2 id="decay:sec:theta">The \( \theta \) parameter (not \( \nabla \)?)</h2>

<p>
Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \( \theta \):
<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">def f(theta):
    return theta**2
</pre></div>
<p>
<b>More on \( \theta \).</b>
Here is more text following headline with math.

<p>
Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
\( \frac{1}{2} \), \( {1/2} \), \( \pmb{x} \), \( \frac{Du}{dt} \),
both inline and in block:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
Or with align with label and numbers:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\tag{1}\\ 
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

<h2 id="___sec10">Custom Environments </h2>

<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <code>.tex</code> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<div id="theorem:fundamental1"></div>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b>
Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b>
Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h2 id="subsec:table">Tables</h2>

<p>
<!-- index with comma could fool sphinx -->

<p>
Let us take this table from the manual:

<p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-2">
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><td align="center"><b>time</b></td> <td align="center"><b>velocity</b></td> <td align="center"><b>acceleration</b></td> </tr>

</tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div> <!-- col-xs-2 -->
<p>
The DocOnce source code reads
<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc ccq) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<blockquote>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">  |--------------------------------|

  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre></div>
</blockquote><p>
Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

<p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-2">
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><td align="left"><b>time</b></td> <td align="left"><b>velocity</b></td> <td align="left"><b>acceleration</b></td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   1.0     </td> <td align="left">   1.376512    </td> <td align="left">   11.919          </td> </tr>

</tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div> <!-- col-xs-2 -->
<p>
And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

<p>

<div class="row">

Let us also add a test of quotes such as &quot;double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)&quot;; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that &quot;caused&quot; a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like <code>.txt</code>.

Here is an example: <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#Langtangen_Pedersen_2002">[1]</a> discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, <a href="._testdoc_vagrant002.html#Langtangen_et_al_2002">[2]</a> gave

<!-- --- begin exercise --- -->

<h2 id="Example">Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises</h2>

<p>
Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with <code>Example:</code>
and then, with the command-line option <code>--examples_as_exercises</code> be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
State some problem.

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
State some other problem.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b>
A hint can be given.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b>
Maybe even another hint?

<p>
<b>Solution.</b>
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

The example in the section <a href="#ex:test:1p1">Example 1: A test function</a> demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function <code>add</code> appears in

<h2 id="ex:test:1p1">Example 1: A test function</h2>

</div>

<h2 id="subsubsec:ex">URLs</h2>

<p>
Testing of URLs: hpl's home page <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>, or
the entire URL if desired, <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>.  Here is a
plain file link <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a>, or
<a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self"><tt>testdoc.do.txt</tt></a> or <a href="testdoc.do.txt" target="_self">a link with
newline</a>. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a> or <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self">hpl</a>. Also <code>file:///</code> works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html" target="_self">link to a
file</a> is
fine to have. Moreover, &quot;loose&quot; URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl" target="_self"><tt>http://folk.uio.no/hpl</tt></a>, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

<p>
Mail addresses can also be used: <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>hpl@simula.no</tt></a>, or just a <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">mail link</a>, or a raw <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self"><tt>mailto:hpl@simula.no</tt></a>.

<p>
Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the <code>latex</code> format:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self">Newton-Cotes</a> formulas
and a <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1" target="_self">good book</a>. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas</tt></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae" target="_self"><tt>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae</tt></a> which has a shebang.

<p>
For the <code>--device=paper</code> option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the <code>--latex_no_program_footnotelink</code>
is used), as in this reference to
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py" target="_self"><tt>decay_mod</tt></a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py" target="_self"><tt>ball1.py</tt></a>,
and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py" target="_self"><tt>ball2.py</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst -->
<!-- format extra blanks make a paragraph break). -->

<p>
<!-- Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link -->
<!-- if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should, -->
<!-- if rst output is desired, but placed in a <code>_static*</code> folder. -->

<p>
More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
<code>--device=paper</code> option must be correct. We have
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, and
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">google</a>, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$

or with number and label, as in <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$

We can refer to this equation by <a href="#mjx-eqn-3">(3)</a>.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \tag{4} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

We can refer to <a href="#mjx-eqn-4">(4)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-5">(5)</a>. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier-Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in <code>CG-2</code>.
Also test \( a_{i-j} \) as well as \( kx-wt \).

To answer this question empirically, let a program

The formula for a circle is given by

$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$

where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <code>n</code> points on a circle:

Ooops, forgot a minus: <code>exp(-x)</code>, otherwise this Python code
must be considered as a good answer. It is more natural,
though, to write the solution to the problem
in mathematical notation:

$$ y(x) = e^{-y}.$$

The format of this document is
sphinx

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

.. is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

.. _sec1:

.. !split

Section 1
=========

Here is a nested list:

  * item1

  * item2

  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  * and a sublist

    * with indented subitem1

    * and a subitem2

  * and perhaps an ordered sublist

   1. first item

   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line

**Here is a list with paragraph heading.**

  * item1

  * item2

Here is a list with subsubsection heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * item1

  * item2


..

    Here are two lines that make up
    a block quote for testing *emphasized words* and **boldface words**,
    also with hypens:
    *pre*-fix, post-*fix*, **pre**-fix, post-**fix**.



Here are two references. Equation |nbsp| :ref:`(4.1) <Eq:my:eq1>` is fine. Eq. |nbsp| :ref:`(4.1) <Eq:my:eq1>` too.
Even Equation :ref:`(4.1) <Eq:my:eq1>` without the tilde.
This equation appears in another part if this document is split.

.. _subsec1:

Subsection 1
------------

.. index:: somefunc function

.. Refer to section/appendix etc. at the beginning of the line

.. and other special fix situations for HTML.

More text, with a reference back to
the section :ref:`sec1` and :ref:`subsec1`, and further to the
the sections :ref:`subsec1` and :ref:`subsubsec:ex`, which
encourages you to do the tasks in :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`exer:some:formula`.
Appendices     :ref:`app1` and :ref:`app2` are also nice elements.

Test Section reference at beginning of line and after a sentence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The section :ref:`subsec1` is fine.
The section :ref:`subsubsec:ex` too.

.. sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Computer code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file with a plain text verbatim environment
(``envir=ccq``):

.. code-block:: text

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: text

        !bc pycod
        def f(x):
            return x+1
        !ec

which gets rendered as

.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Test paragraph and subsubsection headings before
before code.

**Paragraph heading before code.**

.. code-block:: python

        import sys
        sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)

Subsubsection heading before code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

        def h(z):
            return z+1

Now a complete program to be shown via Python Online Tutorial:

.. raw:: html

        <iframe width="950" height="500" frameborder="0"
                src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=class+Line%3A%0A++++def+__init__%28self%2C+a%2C+b%29%3A%0A++++++++self.a%2C+self.b+%3D+a%2C+b%0A%0A++++def+__call__%28self%2C+x%29%3A%0A++++++++a%2C+b+%3D+self.a%2C+self.b%0A++++++++return+a%2Ax+%2B+b%0A%0Aline+%3D+Line%282%2C+1%29%0Ay+%3D+line%28x%3D3%29%0Aprint+y&curInstr=0&py=2&cumulative=false">
        </iframe>

Another complete program to be typeset as a sage cell:

.. sagecellserver::

        a = 2
        b = 3
        print 'a+b:', a + b
        
        # In a sage cell we can also plot
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        from numpy import *
        x = linspace(0, 4*pi, 101)
        y = exp(-0.1*x)*cos(x)
        plot(x, y)
        xlabel('x'); ylabel('y')
        show()

Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1

Standard Python shell sessions:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> from numpy import sin
        >>> # Some comment
        >>> x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

IPython sessions:

.. code-block:: ipy

        In [1]: from numpy import sin
        
        In [2]: # Some comment
        
        In [3]: x = sin(1.2); print 'Value:', x
        Value: 0.932039085967

.. This one tests a + sign before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

.. The next should get correctly typset in sphinx (cod is fcod)

.. It also tests emoji before code

And a little bit of Fortran: :dizzy_face:

.. code-block:: text

        !bc cod
              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end
        !ec

which then is typeset as

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine midpt(x, length, a, b)
              real*8 a, b, x
              x = (a + b)/2
              length = b - a
              return
              end

HTML:

.. code-block:: html

        <table>
        <tr><td>Column 1</td><td>Column 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0.67526 </td><td>0.92871 </td></tr>
        <!-- comment -->
        </table>

But inline HTML code is also important, like text that starts with
``<a href="`` (which can destroy the following text if not properly
quoted).

And here is a system call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2

Any valid pygments lexer/language name can appear to, e.g.,

.. code-block:: text

        !bc restructuredtext
        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.
        !ec

results in

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

        =======
        Heading
        =======
        
        Some text.

.. Here goes hidden code.

.. Python can be treated by some formats, Fortran is always out.

Finally, ``!bc do`` supports highlighting of DocOnce source:

.. code-block:: doconce

        ======= DocOnce test file =======
        
        ===== Computer code =====
        
        Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
        code blocks:
        
        !bc pycod
        from math import sin
        
        def f(x):
            """Example on a function."""
            return sin(x) + 1
        
        print f(0)
        !ec
        
        
        ===== Mathematics =====
        
        Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0$, or typeset
        as equations:
        
        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \boldsymbol{u} &= \nabla\phi .
        \end{align*}
        !et
        
        === Subsubsection heading ===
        
        DocOnce files can have chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections.
        
        __Paragraph heading.__ Paragraphs may have headings.

It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! For
spellcheck, test ``a verbatim expression`` in ``another`` in a ``third``.
Also test exclamation mark as in ``!bc`` and ``!ec`` as well as ``a != b``.
Also test backslashes and braces like ``\begin``, ``\begin{enumerate}``,
``\end{this}\end{that}``, and ``{something \inside braces}``.

The following attempt to exemplify colored text does not work in
format sphinx.
Here is some **red color** and an attempt to write **with
green color containing a linebreak

| code.** Some formats will only display 
| this correctly when ``html`` 
| is the output format.

But here some more running text is added which is not part of
the previous blocks with line breaks.

Running OS commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python -c 'print "Testing\noutput\nfrom\nPython."'
        Testing
        output
        from
        Python.

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

Here is a test of footnotes [#footnote]_, which are handy in text.
They are used in different flavors, now in

 * list items (note below that footnotes work after math, verbatim, and URLs - bin fact old and emphasize too!)

 * even with math :math:`\nabla^2u` [#math1]_

 * and code ``h[i] += 1`` [#code]_
   (*must* have space between inline code and footnote!)

 * and `links <http://google.com>`__ [#google-search]_

which gives flexibility in writing.
This is the third [#example-of-the-third-footnote]_ example.

.. [#footnote] Typesetting of the footnote depends on the format.
   Plain text does nothing, LaTeX removes the
   definition and inserts the footnote as part of the LaTeX text.
   reStructuredText and Sphinx employ a similar type of typesetting
   as Extended Markdown and DocOnce, and in HTML we keep the same
   syntax, just displayed properly in HTML.

.. [#math1] Math footnotes can be dangerous since it
   interferes with an exponent.

.. [#code] One-line footnote.

.. [#google-search] `<google.com>`_ is perhaps the most famous
   web site today.

Here is some more text before a new definition of a footnote that was
used above.


.. admonition:: Non-breaking space character

   This paragraph aims to test `non-breaking space character <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space>`__, and a typical
   example where this is needed is in physical units: 7.4 |nbsp| km is traveled
   in |nbsp| :math:`7.4/5.5\approx 1.345` |nbsp| s.  Also check that a |nbsp| `link <http://google.com>`__ |nbsp| is
   not broken across lines (drag the browser window to test this).
   (On the other hand, the tilde is used in
   computer code, e.g., as in ``[~x for x in y]`` or in ``y=~x``, and should
   of course remain a tilde in those contexts.)




.. _subsec:ex:

Subsection 2: Testing figures
-----------------------------

.. index:: figures

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.

.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of a wave*

Figures without captions are allowed and will be inlined.

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 200

.. index:: movies

.. Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png
   :width: 500

   A long caption spanning several lines and containing verbatim words like ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2`` as well as math with subscript as in :math:`t_{i+1}`

.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem

Test URL as figure name:

.. figure:: https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/doc/src/blog/f_plot.png
   :width: 500

Test SVG figure:

.. figure:: http://openclipart.org/people/jpneok/junebug.svg
   :width: 200

.. Test wikimedia type of files that otherwise reside in subdirs

**Remark.**
Movies are tested in separate file ``movies.do.txt``.

.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: text

        def f(theta):
            return theta**2

**More on :math:`\theta`.**
Here is more text following headline with math.

Newcommands must also be tested in this test report:
:math:`\frac{1}{2}`, :math:`{1/2}`, :math:`\pmb{x}`, :math:`\frac{Du}{dt}`,
both inline and in block:

.. math::
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
        \\ 
        \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\ 
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
        

Or with align with label and numbers:

.. _Eq:aligneq1:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq1
        
        \frac{Du}{dt} = 0
        
        

.. math::
          
        \frac{1}{2} = {1/2}
        

.. _Eq:aligneq2:

.. math::
   :label: aligneq2
          
        \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} = \pmb{n}
        
        

Sphinx makes a fix here and splits align into multiple equation
environments.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

.. begin theorem

**Theorem 5.**
Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.

.. end theorem

.. begin proof

**Proof.**
Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`

.. end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------

.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible

.. index:: test two (separate) verbatim expressions which is also possible

.. index::
   single: index with; subindex

.. index with comma could fool sphinx

.. index::
   single: index, with comma, and one more

Let us take this table from the manual:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0     1.4186         -5.01  
2.0   1.376512        11.919  
4.0     1.1E+1     14.717624  
====  ========  ============  

The DocOnce source code reads

.. code-block:: text

          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

====  ========  ============  
time  velocity  acceleration  
====  ========  ============  
0.0   1.4186    -5.01         
1.0   1.376512  11.919        
3.0   1.1E+1    14.717624     
====  ========  ============  

And one with math headings (that are expanded and must be treated
accordingly), verbatim heading and entry, and no space around the pipe
symbol:

=========  ===========  ================  =======  
:math:`i`  :math:`h_i`  :math:`\bar T_i`  ``L_i``  
=========  ===========  ================  =======  
0                    0               288  -0.0065  
1               11,000               216      0.0  
2               20,000               216    0.001  
3               32,000               228   0.0028  
4               47,000               270      0.0  
5               51,000               270  -0.0028  
6               71,000               214  ``NaN``  
=========  ===========  ================  =======  

And add one with verbatim headings (with underscores),
and rows starting with ``|-`` because of a negative number,
and ``|`` right before and after verbatim word (with no space):

=====  =======  =====================  ===========  
exact  ``v_1``  :math:`a_i` + ``v_2``  ``verb_3_``  
=====  =======  =====================  ===========  
    9     9.62                   5.57         8.98  
  -20   -23.39                  -7.65       -19.93  
   10    17.74                  -4.50         9.96  
    0    -9.19                   4.13        -0.26  
=====  =======  =====================  ===========  

Pipe symbols in verbatim and math text in tables used to pose difficulties,
but not anymore:

===============  ===============  
   :math:`S`         command      
===============  ===============  
$ ||a_0|| $      ``norm|length``  
:math:`x\cap y`          ``x|y``  
===============  ===============  

Finally, a table with math
(``bm`` that expands to ``boldsymbol``, was tricky, but
cleanly handled now)
and URLs.

.. Mako code to expand URLs in the table

.. (These types of tables did not work before Jan 2014)

====================================  ==========================================================  ==========================================================  

A test of verbatim words in heading with subscript :math:`a_i`: ``my_file_v1`` and ``my_file_v2``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Paragraph with verbatim and math: ``my_file_v1.py`` and ``my_file_v2.py`` define some math :math:`a_{i-1}`.**
Here is more ``__verbatim__`` code and
some plain text on a new line.

.. Test various types of headlines

**Just bold**
-------------

Some text.

*Just emphasize*
----------------

Some text.

``Just verbatim``
-----------------

Some text.

**Bold** beginning
------------------

Some text.

*Emphasize* beginning
---------------------

Some text.

``Verbatim`` beginning
----------------------

Some text.

Maybe **bold end**
------------------

Some text.

Maybe *emphasize end*
---------------------

Some text.

Maybe ``verbatim end``
----------------------

Some text.

The middle has **bold** word
----------------------------

Some text.

The middle has *emphasize* word
-------------------------------

Some text.

The middle has ``verbatim`` word
--------------------------------

Some text.

***Just emphasize*.**
Some text.

**``Just verbatim``.**
Some text.

***Emphasize* beginning.**
Some text.

**``Verbatim beginning``.**
Some text.

**Maybe *emphasize end*.**
Some text.

**Maybe ``verbatim end``.**
Some text.

**The middle has *emphasize* word.**
Some text.

**The middle has ``verbatim`` word.**
Some text.

**Ampersand.**
We can test Hennes & Mauritz, often abbreviated H&M, but written
as ``Hennes & Mauritz`` and ``H & M``.
A sole ``&`` must also work.

.. Note: substitutions must not occur inside verbatim, just in ordinary text.

.. code-block:: text

        # Just to check that ampersand works in code blocks:
        c = a & b

**Quotes.**
Let us also add a test of quotes such as "double quotes, with numbers
like 3.14 and newline/comma and hyphen (as in double-quote)"; written
in the standard LaTeX-style that gives correct LaTeX formatting and
ordinary double quotes for all non-LaTeX formats.  Here is another
sentence that "caused" a bug in the past because double backtick
quotes could imply verbatim text up to a verbatim word starting with
period, like ``.txt``.

Bibliography test
-----------------

Here is an example: [Ref01]_ discussed propagation of
large destructive water waves, [Ref02]_ gave
an overview of numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations,
while the use of Backward Kolmogorov equations for analyzing
random vibrations was investigated in [Ref03]_.
The book chapter [Ref04]_ contains information on
C++ software tools for programming multigrid methods. A real retro
reference is [Ref05]_ about a big FORTRAN package.
Multiple references are also possible, e.g., see
[Ref01]_ [Ref04]_.

We need to cite more than 10 papers to reproduce an old formatting
problem with blanks in the keys in reST format:
[Ref06]_ [Ref03]_ [Ref07]_ [Ref01]_
and
[Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_ [Ref11]_ [Ref12]_ [Ref13]_
and all the work of
[Ref14]_ [Ref04]_ [Ref15]_ as well as
old work [Ref05]_ and [Ref16]_, and the
talk [Ref17]_.
Langtangen also had two thesis [Ref18]_ [Ref16]_.
More retro citations are
the old ME-IN323 book [Ref19]_ and the
[Ref20]_ OONSKI '94 paper.

.. _Example:

Example 1: Examples can be typeset as exercises
-----------------------------------------------

Examples can start with a subsection heading starting with ``Example:``
and then, with the command-line option ``--examples_as_exercises`` be
typeset as exercises. This is useful if one has solution
environments as part of the example.

**a)**
State some problem.

**Solution.**
The answer to this subproblem can be written here.

**b)**
State some other problem.

**Hint 1.**
A hint can be given.

**Hint 2.**
Maybe even another hint?

**Solution.**
The answer to this other subproblem goes here,
maybe over multiple doconce input lines.

.. --- end exercise ---

User-defined environments
-------------------------

The example in the section :ref:`ex:test:1p1` demonstrates how to write a test function.
That is, a special test function for a function ``add`` appears in
the example in the section :ref:`ex:test:1p1`.

.. _ex:test:1p1:

Example 1: A test function
--------------------------

Suppose we want to write a test function for checking the
implementation of a Python function for addition.

.. code-block:: python

        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def test_add():
            a = 1; b = 1
            expected = a + b
            computed = add(a, b)
            assert expected == computed

.. _ex:math:1p1:

Example 2: Addition
-------------------

We have

.. math::
         1 + 1 = 2 


.. admonition:: Highlight box

   This environment is used to highlight something:
   
   .. math::
            E = mc^2




.. _subsubsec:ex:

URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__, or
the entire URL if desired, `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.  Here is a
plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or
`<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link with
newline <testdoc.do.txt>`__. Can test spaces with the link with word
too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__ or `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`__. Also ``file:///`` works: `link to a
file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/doc/demos/manual/manual.html>`__ is
fine to have. Moreover, "loose" URLs work, i.e., no quotes, just
the plain URL as in `<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_, if followed by space, comma,
colon, semi-colon, question mark, exclamation mark, but not a period
(which gets confused with the periods inside the URL).

Mail addresses can also be used: `hpl@simula.no <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`__, or just a `mail link <mailto:hpl@simula.no>`__, or a raw `<mailto:hpl@simula.no>`_.

Here are some tough tests of URLs, especially for the ``latex`` format:
`Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`__ formulas
and a `good book <http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1>`__. Need to test
Newton-Cotes with percentage in URL too:
`<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
and `<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Cotes#Open_Newton.E2.80.93Cotes_formulae>`_ which has a shebang.

For the ``--device=paper`` option it is important to test that URLs with
monospace font link text get a footnote
(unless the ``--latex_no_program_footnotelink``
is used), as in this reference to
`decay_mod <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay/experiments/decay_mod.py>`__, `ball1.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball1.py>`__,
and `ball2.py <http://tinyurl.com/pwyasaa/formulas.ball2.py>`__.

.. Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because in the rst

.. format extra blanks make a paragraph break).

.. Note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". Such files should,

.. if rst output is desired, but placed in a ``_static*`` folder.

More tough tests: repeated URLs whose footnotes when using the
``--device=paper`` option must be correct. We have
`google <http://google.com>`__, `google <http://google.com>`__, and
`google <http://google.com>`__, which should result in exactly three
footnotes.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\bpycod
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\epycod

And some plain text verbatim:

\bccq
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\eccq

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\bpycod
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\epycod
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\bpycod2
def f(x):
    return x
\epycod2
And a complete program

\bpypro2
print "Hello, World!"
\epypro2
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}





\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\bpycod2
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\epycod2
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\bpycod2
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\epycod2
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\bpycod2
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\epycod2
And then we add a figure too.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_mdfboxadmon}[Concluding remarks for the novice.]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}

"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\

\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):

\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}

But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors1admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_colors1admon}




\begin{question_colors1admon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_colors1admon}




\begin{question_colors1admon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_colors1admon}




\begin{warning_colors1admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_colors1admon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_colors1admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_colors1admon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_colors1admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_colors2admon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_colors2admon}





\begin{block_colors2admon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_colors2admon}



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_colors2admon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{question_colors2admon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_colors2admon}




\begin{warning_colors2admon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_colors2admon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_colors2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_colors2admon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_colors2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the

\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}





\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_mdfboxadmon}[Concluding remarks for the novice.]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We

Test warning with title:



\begin{graybox2admon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{graybox2admon}




Test warning with large title with math:



\begin{graybox2admon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{graybox2admon}




Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Block with title.]

% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since

\begin{graybox2admon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{graybox2admon}




% Test one word with a number



\begin{graybox2admon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{graybox2admon}






\begin{graybox2admon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{graybox2admon}




Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).



\begin{graybox2admon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{graybox2admon}




\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.



\begin{graybox2admon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_grayiconadmon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_grayiconadmon}





\begin{block_grayiconadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_grayiconadmon}



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_grayiconadmon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_grayiconadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_grayiconadmon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_grayiconadmon}




\begin{question_grayiconadmon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_grayiconadmon}




\begin{question_grayiconadmon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_grayiconadmon}




\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_grayiconadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_grayiconadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_grayiconadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the

which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.

just because we can.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Warning.}
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
% --- end paragraph admon ---



Test warning with title:


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.}
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
% --- end paragraph admon ---



Test warning with large title with math:


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.}
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
% --- end paragraph admon ---



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Block with title.}
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
% --- end paragraph admon ---





% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Note, eventually!}
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% Test one word with a number


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Point1.}
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Question.}
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Question.}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Tip.}
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
% --- end paragraph admon ---



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
And here comes some text with bad news.
% --- end paragraph admon ---



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Going deeper.}
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.



% inline figure
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.pdf}}
% --- end paragraph admon ---




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Concluding remarks, for the novice.}
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
% --- end paragraph admon ---



\paragraph{Remark.}
The \Verb!remarks! and \Verb!hint! environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[Warning]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}

And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_yellowiconadmon}[Block with title]
\vspace{-2.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon

more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow

\end{block_yellowiconadmon}





\begin{block_yellowiconadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_yellowiconadmon}



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_yellowiconadmon}[Note, eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_yellowiconadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_yellowiconadmon}[Point1]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_yellowiconadmon}




\begin{question_yellowiconadmon}[Question]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_yellowiconadmon}




\begin{question_yellowiconadmon}[Question]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?

\noindent
\end{question_yellowiconadmon}




\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[Tip]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_yellowiconadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_yellowiconadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much

And some more text that can help going into the next page.

\section{Introduction}
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


\subsection{Code}

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=0mm]
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{Verbatim}

And some plain text verbatim:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95]
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Quotes and boxes}

Here is a plain quote environment.


\begin{quote}
Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." \\
By way of corollary, it adds: \\
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." \\
\emph{Source}: \href{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law}}{wikipedia}
\end{quote}


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in {\LaTeX} and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain \emph{box} is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
A generic equation

\[ f(x) = 0 \]
must be solved by a numerical method, such as

\begin{itemize}
 \item Newton's method

 \item The Bisection method

 \item Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting $f(x)=x - g(x)$

 \item The Secant method
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}
Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}

Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


\begin{center}
\begin{Sbox}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\linewidth}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=0mm]
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{Sbox}
\fbox{\TheSbox}
\end{center}



\subsection{Admonitions}

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Warning.]
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item and a list

  \item with items
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with title:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Title ending with math $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4$}.]
{\large And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

\begin{minted}{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{minted}
And a complete program

\begin{minted}{python}
print "Hello, World!"
\end{minted}
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Test warning with large title with math:


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[{\large Watch out for $\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0$ equations}.]
{\large Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
\par}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[Block with title.]
\vspace{0.5mm}\par\noindent
{\footnotesize Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
\emph{without any icon} and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
\par}
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}





\begin{block_mdfboxadmon}[]
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
\end{block_mdfboxadmon}



% Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
% those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Note eventually!]
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define $\theta$ and $\bm{r}$:

\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



% Test one word with a number


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Point1.]
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{question_mdfboxadmon}[Question.]
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{question_mdfboxadmon}




\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[Tip.]
It is of outmost important to

\begin{enumerate}
\item stay cool

\item read hints and tips carefully
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Because here the thing is to do

\begin{minted}{python}
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
\end{minted}
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[]
And here comes some text with bad news.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}



\subsection{Going deeper environments}

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Going deeper.]
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the {\LaTeX} environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

\begin{align*}
\Ddt{u} &= 0
\\
\half &= \halfi\\
\half\x &= \normalvec
\end{align*}

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

\begin{minted}{python}
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
\end{minted}
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

\begin{minted}{python}
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
\end{minted}
And then we add a figure too.



% inline figure

\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}




\subsection{The end}

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


\begin{summary_mdfboxadmon}[Concluding remarks for the novice.]
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
\end{summary_mdfboxadmon}

exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="block alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="block alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="question alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #FEEFB3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="warning alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="notice alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #BDE5F8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h2 id="___sec5">The end </h2>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="summary alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
</div>


<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Warning.</b>
<p>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large">
<b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
<p>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large">
<b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
<p>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small">
<b>Block with title.</b>
<p>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size">
<b>Note, eventually!</b>
<p>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Point1.</b>
<p>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal">
<b>Question.</b>
<p>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal">
<b>Question.</b>
<p>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Tip.</b>
<p>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>

</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Going deeper.</b>
<p>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h2 id="___sec5">The end </h2>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal">
<b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
<p>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.

<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 8px 8px 5px #888888;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Warning.</b>
<p>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large">
<b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
<p>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large">
<b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
<p>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small">
<b>Block with title.</b>
<p>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size">
<b>Note, eventually!</b>
<p>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Point1.</b>
<p>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal">
<b>Question.</b>
<p>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal">
<b>Question.</b>
<p>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Tip.</b>
<p>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>

</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Going deeper.</b>
<p>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fcf8e3"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h2 id="___sec5">The end </h2>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal">
<b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
<p>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.

<b>Remark.</b>
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

<p>First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions

<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">automake_sphinx.py</span></tt> fixes the HTML file generated by Sphinx
so that all styles for admonitions have a colored background.</p>

<p>Here is a plain quote environment.</p>

</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">The boxes below are shown without any extra formatting in reST
and Sphinx. We could use an admonition environment, but requires
a title.</p>
</div>
<p>A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let&#8217;s show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.</p>
<p>First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:</p>
<p>A generic equation</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x) = 0\]</div>
<p>must be solved by a numerical method, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Newton&#8217;s method</li>
<li>The Bisection method</li>
<li>Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting <span class="math">\(f(x)=x - g(x)\)</span></li>
<li>The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x}\]</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">some_code</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>

<div class="section" id="admonitions">
<h3>Admonitions<a class="headerlink" href="#admonitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let us start with a plain warning environment.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>and a list</li>
<li>with items</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.</p>
</div>
<p>Test warning with title:</p>
<div class="admonition-title-ending-with-math-math-sqrt-2-approx-1-4 admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Title ending with math <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4\)</span></p>
<p>And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.</p>
<p>Also some code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>

</div>
<p>And a complete program</p>
<div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Test warning with large title with math:
(we have no impact on the font size in the title in Sphinx)</p>
<div class="admonition-watch-out-for-math-nabla-cdot-boldsymbol-u-0-equations admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Watch out for <span class="math">\(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0\)</span> equations</p>
<p class="last">Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.</p>
</div>
<p>Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.</p>
<div class="admonition-block-with-title admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Block with title</p>
<p class="last">Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.</p>
</div>
<p>Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, for the following <em>block admon</em> (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!bblock</span></tt>)
we have not specified any title, and DocOnce then
applies the generic title &#8220;Notice:&#8221; for the Sphinx format:</p>
<div class="admonition-notice admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Notice</p>
<p class="last">Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-note-eventually admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note, eventually</p>
<p>Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{r}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="last math">
\[\begin{split}\theta &amp;= q^2,\\

</div>
<p>Next is a warning without a title (&#8220;none&#8221; implies no title).
Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, we have not specified any title, and DocOnce then
applies the generic title &#8220;Notice:&#8221;</p>
<div class="admonition-notice admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Notice</p>
<p class="last">And here comes some text with bad news.</p>

<div class="section" id="going-deeper-environments">
<h3>Going deeper environments<a class="headerlink" href="#going-deeper-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.</p>
<div class="admonition-going-deeper admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Going deeper</p>
<p>We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.</p>
<p>Let us start with some equations:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{Du}{dt} &amp;= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &amp;= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &amp;= \pmb{n}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this &#8220;Going deeper&#8221; environment targets.</p>

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/lyx_warning.png" hspace="5" alt="warning"></td>
<th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Warning.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-normal">And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.</div>
</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">

</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-large">And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p></div>
</p></td></tr>

<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">

<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>

<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon

about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.</div>

<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>

<table width="95%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width="25" align="center" valign="top">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/html_images/lyx_notice.png" hspace="5" alt="notice"></td>
<th align="left" valign="middle"><b>Going deeper.</b></th>
</tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" valign="top"><p>
<div class="alert-text-normal">We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>


<!-- admonition: block, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: block, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: question, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: question, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>


<!-- admonition: warning, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>


<!-- admonition: notice, typeset as paragraph -->
<div class="alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

half <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">0.5</span>
x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Warning.</b>
<p>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large">
<b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
<p>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>def f(x):
    return x
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
And a complete program

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  pypro-->
<pre><code>print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-large">
<b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
<p>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-small">
<b>Block with title.</b>
<p>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-illegal-size">
<b>Note, eventually!</b>
<p>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Point1.</b>
<p>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal">
<b>Question.</b>
<p>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-question alert-text-normal">
<b>Question.</b>
<p>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Tip.</b>
<p>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-notice alert-text-normal">
<b>Going deeper.</b>
<p>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre><code>class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
And then we add a figure too.

<p>
<center><p><img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" align="bottom" width=400></p></center>
</div>


<h2 id="___sec5">The end </h2>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-summary alert-text-normal">
<b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):
    r <span style="color: #666666">=</span> diff(u, t) <span style="color: #666666">+</span> u<span style="color: #666666">*</span>grad(u)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> r

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

<h2 id="___sec5">The end </h2>

<p>
A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal"><b>Concluding remarks, for the novice.</b>
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Warning</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \)</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-body">
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>
</div>


<p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-body">
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Note, eventually!</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Point1</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>
</div>


<p>
<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Question</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>
</div>


<p>
<div class="panel panel-success">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Question</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>


<p>
<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Tip</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title"></h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="panel-title">Going deeper.</h3>
  </div>
<div class="panel-body">
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<h1 id="___sec0">Introduction </h1>
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

<h2 id="___sec1">Code </h2>

<p>
Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
And some plain text verbatim:

<p>

<!-- code=text typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</pre></div>

<h2 id="___sec2">Quotes and boxes </h2>

<p>
Here is a plain quote environment.

<p>
<blockquote>
    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
    By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
    "That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
    <em>Source</em>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law" target="_self">wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

<p>
A plain <em>box</em> is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

<p>
First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
A generic equation

$$ f(x) = 0 $$

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

<ul>
 <li> Newton's method</li>
 <li> The Bisection method</li>
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting \( f(x)=x - g(x) \)</li>
 <li> The Secant method</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- end box -->

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
$$
\begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation}
$$
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<p>
Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:

<p>

<!-- begin box -->
<div style="width: 95%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 4px;">
<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">some_code</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> sin(x)<span style="color: #666666">*</span>exp(<span style="color: #666666">1-</span>x)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>
<!-- end box -->


<h2 id="___sec3">Admonitions </h2>

<p>
Let us start with a plain warning environment.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

<ul>
  <li> and a list</li>
  <li> with items</li>
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
</div>


<p>
Test warning with title:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-large"><b>Title ending with math \( \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 \).</b>
And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

<p>
Also some code:

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">f</span>(x):
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">return</span> x
</pre></div>
<p>
And a complete program

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pypro) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Test warning with large title with math:

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-large"><b>Watch out for \( \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0 \) equations.</b>
Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
</div>


<p>
Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-small"><b>Block with title.</b>
Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
<em>without any icon</em> and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b></b>
Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
</div>


<p>
<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-illegal-size"><b>Note, eventually!</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define \( \theta \) and \( \boldsymbol{r} \):

$$
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}
\end{align*}
$$
</div>


<p>
<!-- Test one word with a number -->

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b>Point1.</b>
Ah, we are soon close to the end.
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>
So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info alert-text-normal"><b>Question.</b>

<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b>Tip.</b>
It is of outmost important to

<ol>
<li> stay cool</li>
<li> read hints and tips carefully</li>
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">import</span> <span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">urllib</span>

<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">grab</span>(url, filename):
    urllib<span style="color: #666666">.</span>urlretrieve(url, filename<span style="color: #666666">=</span>filename)
</pre></div>
<p>
</div>


<p>
Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b></b>
And here comes some text with bad news.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Going deeper environments </h2>

<p>
Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b>Going deeper.</b>
We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

<p>
Let us start with some equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<p>

<!-- code=python (!bc pycod) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">Dudt</span>(u):

x <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #666666">2*</span>n
</pre></div>
<p>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<p>

#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Testing admons

By '''hpl'''
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

<!-- !split -->
== Introduction ==
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.


==== Code ====

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</syntaxhighlight>

And some plain text verbatim:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Quotes and boxes ====

Here is a plain quote environment.


{{quote box
| quote = Sayre's law states that
"in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
proportional to the value of the issues at stake." <br />
By way of corollary, it adds: <br />
"That is why academic politics are so bitter." <br />
''Source'': [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law wikipedia]
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
}}



Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


A plain ''box'' is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' A generic equation

:<math>
 f(x) = 0 
</math>
must be solved by a numerical method, such as


<ul>
 <li> Newton's method
 <li> The Bisection method
 <li> Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting <math>f(x)=x - g(x)</math>
 <li> The Secant method
</ul>
}}


Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' :<math>
f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} </math>
}}



Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' <syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def some_code(x):
    return sin(x)*exp(1-x)
</syntaxhighlight>
}}





==== Admonitions ====

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Warning.''' And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.


<ul>
  <li> and a list
  <li> with items
</ul>

We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
And more and more text.
}}



Test warning with title:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Title ending with math <math>\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4</math>.''' And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.

Also some code:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def f(x):
    return x
</syntaxhighlight>
And a complete program

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
print "Hello, World!"
</syntaxhighlight>
}}



Test warning with large title with math:


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 130%;
| text = '''Watch out for <math>\nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0</math> equations.''' Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
of view.
}}



Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


{{mbox
| type = Block with title.
| textstyle = font-size: 80%;
| text = '''Block with title.''' Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
''without any icon'' and is useful when you want some admons with icon
and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
of understanding.
}}





{{mbox
| type = 
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.
}}



<!-- Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since -->
<!-- those formats automatically add : to the admonition title. -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: illegal-size;
| text = '''Note, eventually!''' Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
But first a bit of math where we define <math>\theta</math> and <math>\bm{r}</math>:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\theta &= q^2,\\
\bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}
\end{align*}
</math>
}}



<!-- Test one word with a number -->


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Point1.''' Ah, we are soon close to the end.
}}




{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
}}




{{mbox
| type = Question.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Question.''' 
<ol>
 <li> Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?
</ol>
}}




{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Tip.''' It is of outmost important to


<ol>
<li> stay cool
<li> read hints and tips carefully
</ol>

Because here the thing is to do

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
</syntaxhighlight>
}}



Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''''' And here comes some text with bad news.
}}



==== Going deeper environments ====

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Going deeper.''' We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

Let us start with some equations:

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\frac{Du}{dt} &= 0
\\
\frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\
\frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}
\end{align*}
</math>

The implementation of such complicated equations in computer
code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets.

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def Dudt(u):
    r = diff(u, t) + u*grad(u)
    return r

half = 0.5
x = 2*n
</syntaxhighlight>
And some more text that can help going into the next page.
Longer computer code requires vertical space:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h

class Backward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x) - f(x-h))/h

class Central2(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

class Central4(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (4./3)*(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (1./3)*(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h)

class Central6(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
               (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
               (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)

class Forward3(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
</syntaxhighlight>
And then we add a figure too.

==== The end ====

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


{{mbox
| type = Concluding remarks, for the novice.
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Concluding remarks, for the novice.''' We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
}}



''Remark.''
The <code>remarks</code> and <code>hint</code> environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

Introduction
============
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

Note that ``automake_sphinx.py`` fixes the HTML file generated by Sphinx
so that all styles for admonitions have a colored background.

Code
----

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons:

.. code-block:: python

        def some_code(x):
            return sin(x)*exp(1-x)

And some plain text verbatim:

.. code-block:: text

        x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
        x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1

Quotes and boxes
----------------

Here is a plain quote environment.


..

    Sayre's law states that
    "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
    proportional to the value of the issues at stake." 
    
    | By way of corollary, it adds: 
    | "That is why academic politics are so bitter." 
    | *Source*: `wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law>`__



Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.


.. warning::
    The boxes below are shown without any extra formatting in reST
    and Sphinx. We could use an admonition environment, but requires
    a title.




A plain *box* is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so since the admon needs a title
   (the box formatting is therefore just ignored)

A generic equation

.. math::
         f(x) = 0 

must be solved by a numerical method, such as

 * Newton's method

 * The Bisection method

 * Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting :math:`f(x)=x - g(x)`

 * The Secant method

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so since the admon needs a title
   (the box formatting is therefore just ignored)


.. math::
         f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x}


Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so since the admon needs a title
   (the box formatting is therefore just ignored)


.. code-block:: python

        def some_code(x):
            return sin(x)*exp(1-x)


Admonitions
-----------

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


.. warning::
    And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
    test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
    in comparison with the other admons.
    
      * and a list
    
      * with items
    
    We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.
    And more and more text.




Test warning with title:


.. admonition:: Title ending with math :math:`\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4`

   And here comes some text with bad news in larger font.
   
   Also some code:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           def f(x):
               return x
   
   And a complete program
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           print "Hello, World!"




Test warning with large title with math:
(we have no impact on the font size in the title in Sphinx)


.. admonition:: Watch out for :math:`\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0` equations

   Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point
   of view.




Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


.. admonition:: Block with title

   Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset
   *without any icon* and is useful when you want some admons with icon
   and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have
   more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks
   about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow
   of understanding.




Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, for the following *block admon* (``!bblock``)
we have not specified any title, and DocOnce then
applies the generic title "Notice:" for the Sphinx format:


.. admonition:: Notice

   Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon
   and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.




.. Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since

.. those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.


.. admonition:: Note, eventually

   Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!).
   But first a bit of math where we define :math:`\theta` and :math:`\boldsymbol{r}`:
   
   .. math::
           
           \theta &= q^2,\\
           \boldsymbol{r} &= \varrho\boldsymbol{i}




.. Test one word with a number


.. admonition:: Point1

   Ah, we are soon close to the end.





.. admonition:: Question

   So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?





.. admonition:: Question

    1. Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support?





.. admonition:: Tip

   It is of outmost important to
   
   1. stay cool
   
   2. read hints and tips carefully
   
   Because here the thing is to do
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           import urllib
           
           def grab(url, filename):
               urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)




Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).
Admonitions must have a title in Sphinx, otherwise they are not
shown. Here, we have not specified any title, and DocOnce then
applies the generic title "Notice:"


.. admonition:: Notice

   And here comes some text with bad news.




Going deeper environments
-------------------------

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


.. admonition:: Going deeper

   We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the
   task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the
   meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the
   page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break,
   which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.

           class Central6(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (3./2) *(f(x+h)   - f(x-h))  /(2*h) - \
                          (3./5) *(f(x+2*h) - f(x-2*h))/(4*h) + \
                          (1./10)*(f(x+3*h) - f(x-3*h))/(6*h)
           
           class Forward3(Diff):
               def __call__(self, x):
                   f, h = self.f, self.h
                   return (-(1./6)*f(x+2*h) + f(x+h) - 0.5*f(x) - \
                           (1./3)*f(x-h))/h
   
   And then we add a figure too.

      :width: 400




The end
-------

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


.. admonition:: Concluding remarks, for the novice

   We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
   a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
   Titles should be optional.




**Remark.**
The ``remarks`` and ``hint`` environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

Introduction
============
First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

Code
----

Need some code outside admons for color and font comparisons::

        def some_code(x):
            return sin(x)*exp(1-x)

And some plain text verbatim::

        x=1.0 y=0.9 z=0.4
        x=1.1 y=0.3 z=0.1

Quotes and boxes
----------------

Here is a plain quote environment.

        Sayre's law states that
        "in any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely
        proportional to the value of the issues at stake." 
        By way of corollary, it adds: 
        "That is why academic politics are so bitter." 
        *Source*: wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law)


Does quotes with title also work? No...cannot work in LaTeX and HTML
and then it does not make sense to support it.

A plain *box* is sometimes useful. Let's show it here for comparison
with admons (especially the block admon has much in common with a box).
The box is more aimed at framing a law or an equation.

First a simple block with text, an equation, and a list:


|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| A generic equation::                                         |
|                                                              |
|         \[ f(x) = 0 \]                                       |
|                                                              |
| must be solved by a numerical method, such as                |
|                                                              |
|  * Newton's method                                           |
|                                                              |
|  * The Bisection method                                      |
|                                                              |
|  * Fixed-point (Picard) iteration by rewriting f(x)=x - g(x) |
|                                                              |
|  * The Secant method                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|

Now test a box with equation only (note that this line continues the
box, it is not a new paragraph):


|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|         \begin{equation} f(x) = \sin(x)e^{1-x} \end{equation} |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|


Let's begin a new paragraph and show a box with code only:


|------------------------------------|
|         def some_code(x):          |
|             return sin(x)*exp(1-x) |
|------------------------------------|


Admonitions
-----------

Let us start with a plain warning environment.


Warning ---------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                |
| And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We  |
| test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts     |
| in comparison with the other admons.                           |
|                                                                |
|   * and a list                                                 |
|                                                                |
|   * with items                                                 |
|                                                                |
| We continue with more text to see how that affects the layout. |
| And more and more text.                                        |
| And more and more text.                                        |
| And more and more text.                                        |
| And more and more text.                                        |
| And more and more text.                                        |
| And more and more text.                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|


Test warning with title:


Title ending with math \sqrt{2}\approx 1.4 --------------|
|                                                        |
| And here comes some text with bad news in larger font. |
|                                                        |
| Also some code::                                       |
|                                                        |
|         def f(x):                                      |
|             return x                                   |
|                                                        |
| And a complete program::                               |
|                                                        |
|         print "Hello, World!"                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|


Test warning with large title with math:


Watch out for \nabla\cdot\bm{u}=0 equations ---------------------|
|                                                                |
| Divergence freedom is often problematic from a numerical point |
| of view.                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|


Then we test a block, which is guaranteed to never have any admon icon.


Block with title --------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                        |
| Here is a block of text with title. It is typeset                      |
| *without any icon* and is useful when you want some admons with icon   |
| and some without. With the small font size, as used here, one can have |
| more comment-style text or text that really goes deeper or talks       |
| about fun facts that are not strictly necessary for the main flow      |
| of understanding.                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|



Block ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                                 |
| Here is a block of text with no title. As above, it is typeset without any icon |
| and is useful when you want some admons with icon and some without.             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|



Note, eventually! ----------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                           |
| Ah, we are soon close to the end (with illegal font size specification!). |
| But first a bit of math where we define \theta and \bm{r}::               |
|                                                                           |
|         \begin{align*}                                                    |
|         \theta &= q^2,\\                                                  |
|         \bm{r} &= \varrho\bm{i}                                           |
|         \end{align*}                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|



Point1 -----------------------------|
|                                   |
| Ah, we are soon close to the end. |
|-----------------------------------|



Question ----------------------------------------------------|
|                                                            |
| So, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support? |
|------------------------------------------------------------|



Question ---------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                       |
|  1. Once more, how many admonition environments does DocOnce support? |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|



Tip -----------------------------------------------------|
|                                                        |
| It is of outmost important to                          |
|                                                        |
| 1. stay cool                                           |
|                                                        |
| 2. read hints and tips carefully                       |
|                                                        |
| Because here the thing is to do::                      |
|                                                        |
|         import urllib                                  |
|                                                        |
|         def grab(url, filename):                       |
|             urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename) |
|--------------------------------------------------------|


Next is a warning without a title ("none" implies no title).


|-----------------------------------------|
| And here comes some text with bad news. |
|-----------------------------------------|


Going deeper environments
-------------------------

Here is a long notice environment with a custom title and much
text, math and code.


Going deeper. ---------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                      |
| We have some equations that should be preceded by much text, so the  |
| task is to write and write. The number of words, and not the         |
| meaning, is what counts here. We need desperately to fill up the     |
| page in the hope that some admonitions will experience a page break, |
| which the LaTeX environment should handle with ease.                 |
|                                                                      |
| Let us start with some equations::                                   |
|                                                                      |

|         \\                                                           |
|         \frac{1}{2} &= {1/2}\\                                       |
|         \frac{1}{2}\pmb{x} &= \pmb{n}                                |
|         \end{align*}                                                 |

| The implementation of such complicated equations in computer         |
| code is task that this "Going deeper" environment targets::          |
|                                                                      |

The end
-------

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
just because we can.


Concluding remarks, for the novice ---------------------------------|
|                                                                   |
| We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have |
| a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.              |
| Titles should be optional.                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|


*Remark.*
The remarks and hint environments are not allowed outside
exercises (and problems and projects too).

[hpl: Comments are typeset as usual in DocOnce.]

!bpop highlight-red
Here we have a paragraph to pop up in red.<linebreak>

One can also have ordinary notes.
Over multiple lines.

!eblock

!split
===== Some math and computer code =====

## Command and [] used to be problematic in blocks, check that it is ok

!bblock A simple, mathematical formula where $t\in [0,\pi]$:
!bt
\[ f(x,y,t) = e^{-xt}\sin\pi y \]
!et
!eblock

!bblock Bash demanded more of DocOnce than Python, so let's do Bash:
First, inline `$? != 0`, then comments with dollar variables (and minted
style):

!bc shcod
var=10
# $1, $2, ... are command-line args
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then   # $? reflects success or not
  echo "Great!"
fi
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Pop ups inside code blocks (for Beamer slides only) =====

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return 42 + x

|\pause|
def g(x):
    return f(42)

|\pause|
print g(13)
!ec

!split
===== Various admon blocks =====

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

!bpop
!bnotice (large) Key PDE (with large title and math font):
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \]
!et
!enotice
!epop

!bpop
!bsummary None
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
!esummary
!epop

!bpop
!bwarning (small)
Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.

# Document for Testing Some Basic and Some Challenging Constructs in DocOnce Slides


###**Hans Petter Langtangen** at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo


### Jan 32, 2100

---

# This is the first section
<!-- Short title: First -->

---

## Figure and bullet list

*Title with comma, and brackets: \\( [a,b] \\)* 
  * Here is a *wave signal* \\( f(x-ct) \\)
  * It moves with velocity \\( c \\)
  * But here it is just a figure


.center[<img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" width=300>]


---

## Slide with pop-ups in red and notes

[hpl 1: Comments are typeset as usual in DocOnce.]

<!-- !bpop highlight-red -->
Here we have a paragraph to pop up in red.<br />
And a line more
---

## A LaTeX document


```
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\begin{document}

\title{Here goes the title...}
\author{John Doe \and
Jane Doe\footnote{\texttt{jane.doe@cyber.net}.}}
\date{\today}
\maketitle
```

*Notice.* 
LaTeX has a lot of backslashes.


```
\section{Heading}
bla-bla
\end{document}
```

---

## An HTML document


```html
<html><head></head><body bgcolor="red">
<title>Here goes the title...<title>
<h1>Section heading</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

---

# Second section

.center[<img src="../doc/src/manual/fig/wave1D.png" width=600>]



---

## Some math and computer code


*A simple, mathematical formula where \\( t\in [0,\pi] \\):* 
$$
f(x,y,t) = e^{-xt}\sin\pi y
$$

*Bash demanded more of DocOnce than Python, so let's do Bash:* 
First, inline `\\( ? != 0`, then comments with dollar variables (and minted
style):


```shell
var=10
#  \\)1, \\( 2, ... are command-line args
if [  \\)? -eq 0 ]; then   # $? reflects success or not
  echo "Great!"
fi
```



---

## Pop ups inside code blocks (for Beamer slides only)


```python
def f(x):
    return 42 + x

def g(x):
    return f(42)

print g(13)
```

---

## Various admon blocks

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

*Key PDE (with large title and math font):* 
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u
$$

*None* 
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.


Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.

===== Fundamental question =====

When I write some scientific material,

 * a LaTeX document,
 * a blog post (HTML),
 * some web pages (HTML),
 * a Sphinx document,
 * some Markdown files,

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

!bpop highlight-red
Probably not, but I have a solution :-)
!epop

!split

===== LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =====

 * LaTeX inline math: works with all (LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki)
 * LaTeX equation math:
    * _LaTeX_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ... (numerous!)
    * _MathJax_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _MediaWiki_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * _Sphinx_: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * _Markdown_: `equation*`, `equation`, `eqnarray*`, `align*` (but no labels)

!split
===== LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =====

!bpop
 * Figures: all
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Movies: LaTeX (can run separately), just raw embedded HTML in others
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX
 * Fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX; inline tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX
 * Margin notes: LaTeX
 * Page references: LaTeX
 * Footnotes: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Bibliography: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Hyperlinks: all (but not on paper!)

!bpop
Conclusion: Highly non-trivial to translate a LaTeX document into something
based on HTML and vice versa.

# Insert index items in the source
idx{key word1} idx{key word2}

# Label
===== Some section =====
label{this:section}

# Make reference
As we saw in Section ref{this:section}, references, index
items and labels follow a syntax similar to LaTeX
but without backslashes.

# Make reference to equations
See (ref{eq1})-(ref{myeq}).

# Make hyperlink
"some link text": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"

# Hyperlink with complete URL as link text
URL: "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"
!ec

!split
===== DocOnce: figures and movies =====

!bnotice
Figure with HTML and LaTeX info, and caption, *all on one line*:
!enotice

!bc
FIGURE: [figdir/myfig, width=300 frac=1.2] My caption. label{fig1}

# This figure will be 300 pixels wide in HTML and span 1.2 times
# the linewidth in LaTeX.
!ec

Movies are also supported:

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]
!ec
and rendered as

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]

!split
===== DocOnce: math =====

Inline math as in LaTeX:

!bc
...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.
!ec
gets rendered as ...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$ is an integral.


An equation environment is surrounded by `!bt` and `!et` tags,
the rest is plain LaTeX:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
|et
!ec
which is rendered as

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
!et


!split
===== DocOnce: displaying code =====

Code is enclosed in `!bc` and `!ec` tags:

!bc
|bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
|ec
!ec
This gets rendered as

!bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec

!bnotice Language-dependent typesetting of code:
The `!bc` command can be followed by a specification of the computer
language: `pycod` for Python code snippet, `pypro` for complete Python
program, `fcod` for Fortran snippet, `fpro` for Fortran program, and so
forth (`c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `m` for Matlab).

!split
===== DocOnce: displaying interactive demo code =====
label{slide:pot}

With `!bc pyoptpro` or a file `*.pyopt`, the code applies the
"Online Python Tutor": "http://pythontutor.com" for displaying
program flow and state of variables:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/solver.pyopt




!split
===== DocOnce: exercises =====

DocOnce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems*, *projects*,
and *examples*:

!bc

   this point is really comprehensive, and although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes

<p>
When I write some scientific material,

<ul>
 <p><li> a LaTeX document,</li>
 <p><li> a blog post (HTML),</li>
 <p><li> some web pages (HTML),</li>
 <p><li> a Sphinx document,</li>
 <p><li> some Markdown files,</li>
</ul>
<p>

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

\subsection{Fundamental question}

When I write some scientific material,

\begin{itemize}
 \item a {\LaTeX} document,

 \item a blog post (HTML),

 \item some web pages (HTML),

 \item a Sphinx document,

 \item some Markdown files,
\end{itemize}

\noindent
and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

\subsection{DocOnce: exercises}

DocOnce offers a special format for \emph{exercises}, \emph{problems}, \emph{projects},
and \emph{examples}:

\bccq
===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====
label{demo:ex:1}

files = flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf
solutions = mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py
keywords = random numbers; Monte Carlo simulation

!bsubex
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.

!bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Compute the probability of getting heads.

!bans
A short answer: 0.5.
!eans

!bsol
A full solution to this subexercise can go here.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Make another program that computes the probability
of getting at least three heads out of 5 throws.
!esubex
\eccq

Solutions/answers can easily be left out of the document.

\subsection{DocOnce: example on slide code}

\bccq
!split
===== Headline =====

 * Key point 1
 * Key point 2
 * Key point 3 takes very much more text to explain because
   this point is really comprehensive, and although long
   bullet points are not recommended in general, we need
   it here for demonstration purposes

FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/teacher1, width=100]

Key equation:

!bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f \quad\hbox{in }\Omega \]
!et

And maybe a final comment?

\subsection{DocOnce: example on slide code with cells}

One can introduce a table-like layout with MxN cells and
put slide elements in various cell. A cell with position
MN is surrounded by \Verb?!bslidecell MN? and \Verb?!eslidecell?
tags. Below is an example with a bullet list to the left and

When I write some scientific material,

\begin{itemize}
 \item a {\LaTeX} document,

 \item a blog post (HTML),

 \item some web pages (HTML),

 \item a Sphinx document,

 \item some Markdown files,
\end{itemize}

and later want to collect the pieces into a larger document, maybe
some book, or one big web document, is that at all feasible?

Probably not, but I have a solution :-)

TITLE: On Schemes for Exponential Decay
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today

FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/CN_logo, width=300 frac=0.4]

## Comments start with a # and are visible as comments in the
## output. Lines starting with ## are also comments, but not visible
## in the output.

!split
===== Goal =====

The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with "DocOnce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce"
and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.
# #if FORMAT in ("html", "pdflatex", "latex")
!bnotice Layout
This version
utilizes ${SLIDE_TYPE} slides with the theme ${SLIDE_THEME}.
!enotice
# #endif

## Demonstrate use of Mako variables set on the command line
## (see last sentence too). We use Preprocess (run before Mako)
## to leave out the Mako test on SLIDE_THEME and SLIDE_TYPE.
## In that way, we do not need to specify these variables on
## the command line when compiling for LaTeX or other formats
## (e.g. for handouts).

# #if FORMAT == "html"
!bnotice
Speaker notes show up by
% if SLIDE_TYPE == 'reveal':
pressing "s".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'deck':
pressing "n".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
pressing "Ctrl-P".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'html5slides':
pressing "p".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
using the "onstage.html": "https://raw.github.com/hplgit/doconce/master/bundled/dzslides/shells/onstage.html" embedding page.
% endif
!enotice
# #endif

## Add speaker notes (can also use preprocess or mako for this)

!bnotes
The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation $u'=-au$ with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.
!enotes

!split
======= Methods =======

## New slide is indicated by !split at the beginning of a line:

!split
===== Mathematical problem =====

## Use !bslidecell XY and !eslidecell as begin and end for
## defining a cell XY in a table layout of the slide.
## X=0,1,..., Y=0,1,... XY=00 is the upper left cell.
## Here we define cell 00 and 01 (bullet list to the left
## and figure to the right).

!bslidecell 00

## latex blocks are surrounded by !bt and !et

!bt
\begin{align}
u'(t) &= -au(t),
label{ode}\\
u(0)  &= I,
label{initial:value}
\end{align}
!et

 * $t\in (0,T]$
 * $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed parameters
 * $u(t)$ is the unknown function

!eslidecell

## Figures can have a width parameter specifying the pixel
## width in HTML. A caption can be added (after [...]).

!bslidecell 01
FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/teacher2, width=250 frac=0.5]
!eslidecell

!split
===== Numerical solution method =====

## !bpop and !epop surround elements that are to pop up
## as we progress in the slide show.
## They will often not work if there is code inside.

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$
!epop

!bpop
Numerical scheme:
!bt
   \[
   u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
   \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
   \]
!et
!epop

# #if FORMAT == "html"

!split
## Next: embed YouTube video

===== Forward Euler explained =====

MOVIE: [http://youtu.be/PtJrPEIHNJw, width=640 height=480]

# #endif

!split
## Next: exemplify copying code directly from file (start
## with the line matching "def solver" and ending with
## "def verify_three", but not including this last line).

===== Implementation =====

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

@@@CODE ../doc/src/slides/src/solver.py  fromto: def solver@def exact_sol

!split
======= Selected results =======
# Short title: Results


!split
===== The Crank-Nicolson method =====

## Figure filenames do not need extension - the right version is picked

FIGURE: [../doc/src/slides/fig/CN, width=600]

!split
===== The artifacts can be explained by some theory =====

!bpop
Exact solution of the scheme:

!bt
\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]
!et
!epop

!bpop
 * Stability: $|A| < 1$
 * No oscillations: $A>0$
 * Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)
 * $\Delta t < 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)
 * $\Delta t < 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)
!epop

## The summary environment appears in a box in most formats
## (warning, notice, hint, question are other environments)
!bpop
!bsummary Concluding remarks:
Only the Backward Euler scheme is guaranteed to always give
qualitatively correct results.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$

\subsection{Implementation}

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T]; step: dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t

Exact solution of the scheme:

\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]
% !epop

% !bpop
\begin{itemize}
 \item Stability: $|A| < 1$

 \item No oscillations: $A>0$

 \item Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)

 \item $\Delta t < 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)

 \item $\Delta t < 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)

\frametitle{Implementation}

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=2mm]{python}
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T]; step: dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t

Exact solution of the scheme:

\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]

\begin{itemize}
\pause
 \item Stability: $|A| < 1$

\pause
 \item No oscillations: $A>0$

\pause
 \item Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)

\pause
 \item $\Delta t < 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)

\pause
 \item $\Delta t < 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Concluding remarks: }
Only the Backward Euler scheme is guaranteed to always give
qualitatively correct results.

OK, this is fixed:


```python
def f(x, a=1, b=1, c=1):
    return a*x**2 + b*x + c
```

### Updated task list

   - [x] Offer an `f(x)` function
   - [ ] Extension to cubic functions
   - [x] Allowing general coefficient in the quadratic function

Here is a movie in WebM format.
# #if FORMAT == "html"
Note that in HTML format a WebM movie
may actually be the MP4 version of this movie
three alternative sources (MP4, WebM, OGG)
are inserted in the HTML code by default. The command-line
option `--no_mp4_webm_ogg_alternatives` makes the HTML
code use exactly the specified movie file.
# #endif

Here is a movie in WebM format.
Note that in HTML format a WebM movie
may actually be the MP4 version of this movie
three alternative sources (MP4, WebM, OGG)
are inserted in the HTML code by default. The command-line
option <code>--no_mp4_webm_ogg_alternatives</code> makes the HTML
code use exactly the specified movie file.

========= Preface =========

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples
from mathematics and the natural sciences.  We have chosen to use the
Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive
power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax.  Python is easy to
learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer
programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good
language for doing mathematical computing.  It is easy to combine
Python with compiled languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, which are
widely used languages for scientific computations.  A seamless
integration of Python with Java is offered by a special version of
Python called Jython.

The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to
mathematics, physics, biology, and finance.  The reader is expected to
have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in
mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an
advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably
containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus.  Although
not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many
of the examples more meaningful.

Many introductory programming books are quite compact and focus on
listing functionality of a programming language. However, learning to
program is learning how to *think* as a programmer.  This book
has its main focus on the thinking process, or equivalently:
programming as a problem solving technique. That is why most of the
pages are devoted to case studies in programming, where we define a
problem and explain how to create the corresponding program.  New
constructions and programming styles (what we could call theory) is also usually
introduced via examples.  Special attention is paid to verification of
programs and to finding errors. These topics are very demanding for
mathematical software, because the unavoidable numerical
approximation errors are possibly mixed with programming mistakes.

By studying the many examples in the
book, I hope readers will learn how to think right and thereby
write programs in a quicker and more reliable way. Remember, nobody can learn
programming by just reading - one has to solve a large amount of
exercises hands on.  The book is therefore full of exercises of
various types: modifications of existing examples, completely new
problems, or debugging of given programs.

There is a web page associated with this book, URL:
"http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer", which lists the software you
need and explains briefly how to install it.  This page also contains
all the files associated with the program examples in this book.

=== Python version 2 or 3? ===

A common problem among Python programmers is to choose between version
2 or 3, which at the time of this writing means choosing
between version 2.7 and 3.3.
The general recommendation is to go for version 3, but programs are
then not compatible with version 2 and vice versa. There is still
a problem that much useful mathematical software in Python
has not yet been ported to version 3. Therefore, scientific computing
with Python still goes mostly with version 2.
A widely used strategy for software
developers who want to write Python code that works with both versions,
is to develop for v2.7, which is very close to what is accepted
in version 3, and then
use the ranslation tool *2to3* to automatically translate the code
to version 3.

When using v2.7, one should employ the newest syntax
and modules that make the differences beween version 2 and 3 very small.
This strategy is adopted in the present book. Only two
differences between versions 2 and 3 are expected to be significant for
the programs in the book:
`a/b` implies float division in version 3 if `a` and `b`
are integers,
and `print 'Hello'` in version 2 must be turned into a function call
`print('Hello')` in version 3. None of these differences should lead
to any annoying problems when future readers study the book's v2.7
examples, but program in version 3. Anyway, running 2to3 on the
example files generates the corresponding version 3 code.

=== Acknowledgments ===

Several people have helped to make substantial improvements of the
text. Here I list only the names with Norwgian characters to
test the handling of those: Ståle Zerener Haugnæss,
Tobias Vidarssønn Langhoff, and Håkon Møller.

========= Basic array computing and plotting =========

This ${CHAPTER} gives an introduction to arrays: how they are created
and what they can be used for.  Array computing usually ends up with a
lot of numbers. It may be very hard to understand what these numbers
mean by just looking at them. Since the human is a visual animal, a
good way to understand numbers is to visualize them. In this
${CHAPTER} we concentrate on visualizing curves that reflect functions
of one variable; i.e., curves of the form $y=f(x)$.  A synonym for
curve is graph, and the image of curves on the screen is often called
a plot.  We will use arrays to store the information about points
along the curve. In a nutshell, array computing demands visualization
and visualization demands arrays.

All program examples in this ${CHAPTER} can be found as files in the
folder "`src/plot`": "${src_path}/plot".

======= Arrays in Python programs =======

This section introduces array programming in Python, but first we
create some lists and show how arrays differ from lists.

===== Using lists for collecting function data =====

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ and want to evaluate this function
at a number of $x$ points $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.  We could collect
the $n$ pairs $(x_i,f(x_i))$ in a list, or we could collect all the
$x_i$ values, for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, in a list and all the associated
$f(x_i)$ values in another list.  The following interactive session
demonstrates how to create these three types of lists:

!bc py
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**3       # sample function
...
>>> n = 5                 # no of points along the x axis
>>> dx = 1.0/(n-1)        # spacing between x points in [0,1]
>>> xlist = [i*dx for i in range(n)]
>>> ylist = [f(x) for x in xlist]
>>> pairs = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist)]
!ec
Here we have used list comprehensions for achieving compact code. Make
sure that you understand what is going on in these list comprehensions
(if not, try to write the same code using standard `for` loops and
appending new list elements in each pass of the loops).

idx{heterogeneous lists}

The list elements consist of objects of the same type: any element in
`pairs` is a list of two `float` objects, while any element in `xlist`
or `ylist` is a `float`. Lists are more flexible than that, because an
element can be an object of any type, e.g.,

!bc pycod
mylist = [2, 6.0, 'tmp.ps', [0,1]]
!ec
Here `mylist` holds an `int`, a `float`, a string, and a list. This
combination of diverse object types makes up what is known as
*heterogeneous* lists.  We can also easily remove elements from a list
or add new elements anywhere in the list.  This flexibility of lists
is in general convenient to have as a programmer, but in cases where
the elements are of the same type and the number of elements is fixed,
arrays can be used instead. The benefits of arrays are faster
computations, less memory demands, and extensive support for
mathematical operations on the data.  Because of greater efficiency
and mathematical convenience, arrays will be used to a large extent in
this ${BOOK}.  The great use of arrays is also prominent in other
programming environments such as MATLAB, Octave, and R, for instance.
Lists will be our choice instead of arrays when we need the
flexibility of adding or removing elements or when the elements may be
of different object types.

===== Basics of numerical Python arrays =====
label{sec:plot:array:basics}

idx{Numerical Python} idx{NumPy} idx{`numpy`}
idx{array (datatype)} idx{array computing}
idx{vectorization}

An *array* object can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the
following assumptions and features:

  * All elements must be of the same type, preferably integer, real, or complex numbers, for efficient numerical computing and storage.
  * The number of elements must be known when the array is created.
  * Arrays are not part of standard Python - one needs an additional package called *Numerical Python*, often abbreviated as NumPy. The Python name of the package, to be used in `import` statements, is `numpy`.
  * With `numpy`, a wide range of mathematical operations can be done directly on complete arrays, thereby removing the need for loops over array elements. This is commonly called *vectorization* %or *array computing* and may cause a dramatic speed-up of Python programs. Vectorization makes use of the vector computing concepts from Section ref{sec:plot:arraycomp}.
  * Arrays with one index are often called vectors. Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. Arrays can also have three or more indices.

!bnotice Remarks

 o There is actually an
   object type called `array` in standard Python, but this data type is
   not so efficient for mathematical computations, and we will not use it
   in this ${BOOK}.
 o The number of elements in an array *can* be
   changed, but at a substantial computational cost.

!bnotice Remarks on importing NumPy
The statement

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
!ec
with subsequent prefixing of all NumPy functions and variables by `np.`,
has evolved as a standard syntax in the Python scientific computing
community. However, to make Python programs look closer to MATLAB
and ease the transition to and from that language, one can do

!bc pycod
from numpy import *
!ec
to get rid of the prefix (this is evolved as the standard in
*interactive* Python shells). This author prefers mathematical
functions from `numpy` to be written without the prefix to
make the formulas as close as possible to the mathematics.
So, $f(x)=\sinh(x-1)\sin(w t)$ would be coded as

!bc pycod
from numpy import sinh, sin

def f(x):
    return sinh(x-1)*sin(w*t)
!ec
or one may take the less recommended
lazy approach `from numpy import *` and fill up
the program with *a lot* of functions and variables from `numpy`.
!enotice

To convert a list `r` to an array,
we use the `array` function
from `numpy`:

!bc pycod
a = np.array(r)
!ec
To create a new array of length `n`, filled with zeros, we write

!bc pycod
a = np.zeros(n)
!ec
The array elements are of a type that corresponds to Python's
`float` type. A second argument to `np.zeros` can be used to
specify other element types, e.g., `int`.
A similar function,

!bc pycod
a = np.zeros_like(c)
!ec
generates an array of zeros where the length is that of the array `c`
and the element type is the same as those in `c`.  Arrays with more
than one index are treated in Section ref{sec:plot:2Darrays}.

idx{`linspace` (from `numpy`)}idx{`np.linspace` function}

Often one wants an array to have $n$ elements with uniformly
distributed values in an interval $[p,q]$. The `numpy` function
`linspace` creates such arrays:

!bc pycod
a = np.linspace(p, q, n)
!ec

========= Storing results in data files =========

We need to test spaces around footnotes for 2-digit footnotes, which
means we need a lot of URLs, e.g., to files:
"`ball2_cml.py`": "${src_path}/input/ball2_cml.py",
"`bisection_ex.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_ex.py",
"`bisection_movie.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_movie.py",
"`bisection_plot.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_plot.py",
"`bisection.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection.py",
"`bisection_v1.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_v1.py",
"`bisection_v2.py`": "${src_path}/input/bisection_v2.py",
"`c2f_cml.py`": "${src_path}/input/c2f_cml.py",
"`data.txt`": "${src_path}/input/data.txt",
"`Fdeg.dat`": "${src_path}/input/Fdeg.dat",
"`integrate.py`": "${src_path}/input/integrate.py", and
"`interest.py`": "${src_path}/input/interest.py".

======= Writing data to file =======
label{sec:files:writing}

Writing data to file is easy.
There is basically one function to pay attention to: `outfile.write(s)`,
which writes a string `s` to
a file handled by the file object `outfile`. Unlike `print`,
`outfile.write(s)`
does not append a newline character to the written string.
It will therefore
often be necessary to add a newline character,

!bc pycod
outfile.write(s + '\n')
!ec
if the string `s` is meant to appear on a single line in the file
and `s` does not already contain a trailing newline character.
File writing is then a matter of constructing strings containing the
text we want to have in the file and for each such string call
`outfile.write`.

Writing to a file demands
the file object `f`
to be opened for writing:

!bc pycod
# write to new file, or overwrite file:
outfile = open(filename, 'w')

# append to the end of an existing file:
outfile = open(filename, 'a')
!ec

===== Example: Writing a table to file =====

=== Problem ===

As a worked example of file writing,
we shall write out a nested list with tabular data to file.
A sample list may take look as

!bc ccq
[[ 0.75,        0.29619813, -0.29619813, -0.75      ],
 [ 0.29619813,  0.11697778, -0.11697778, -0.29619813],
 [-0.29619813, -0.11697778,  0.11697778,  0.29619813],
 [-0.75,       -0.29619813,  0.29619813,  0.75      ]]
!ec

=== Solution ===

We iterate through the rows (first index) in the list, and for each row,
we iterate through the column values (second index)
and write each value to the file.
At the end of each row, we must insert a newline character in the file to get
a linebreak. The code resides in the file "`write1.py`": "${src_path}/input/write1.py".

The resulting data file becomes

!bc dat
    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
!ec

An extension of this program consists in adding column and row headings:

!bc dat
           column  1     column  2     column  3     column  4
row  1    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
row  2    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
row  3   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
row  4   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
!ec
To obtain this end result, we need to the add some statements to
the program `write1.py`. For the column headings we need
to know the number of columns, i.e., the length of the rows,
and loop from 1 to this length:

!bc pycod
ncolumns = len(data[0])
outfile.write('          ')
for i in range(1, ncolumns+1):
    outfile.write('%10s    ' % ('column %2d' % i))
outfile.write('\n')
!ec
Note the use of a nested printf construction: The text we want to
insert is itself a printf string. We could also have written the
text as `'column  ' + str(i)`, but then the length of the
resulting string would depend on the number of digits in `i`.
It is recommended to always use printf constructions for
a tabular output format, because this gives automatic padding of
blanks so that the width of the output strings remain the same.
As always, the tuning of the widths is done in a trial-and-error
process.

To add the row headings, we need a counter over the row numbers:

!bc pycod
row_counter = 1
for row in data:
    outfile.write('row %2d' % row_counter)
    for column in row:
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % column)
    outfile.write('\n')
    row_counter += 1
!ec
The complete code is found in the file "`write2.py`": "${src_path}/input/write2.py".
We could, alternatively, iterate over the indices in the list:

!bc pycod
for i in range(len(data)):
    outfile.write('row %2d' % (i+1))
    for j in range(len(data[i])):
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % data[i][j])
    outfile.write('\n')
!ec
Some other files and URLs we can mention, just to test a 2-digit footnote,
are

 * "`addall.py`": "${src_path}/input/addall.py"
 * "`addall_v1.py`": "${src_path}/input/addall_v1.py"
 * "`add_cml.py`": "${src_path}/input/add_cml.py"
 * "`add_input.py`": "${src_path}/input/add_input.py"



===== Standard input and output as file objects =====

idx{standard input} idx{standard output}

idx{`sys.stdin`}idx{`sys.stdout`}

Reading user input from the keyboard applies the function
# #ifdef PRIMER_BOOK
`raw_input` as explained in Section ref{sec:input:rawinput}.
# #else
`raw_input`.
# #endif
The keyboard is a medium that the computer in fact
treats as a file, referred to
as *standard input*.

The `print` command prints text in the terminal window. This medium
is also viewed as a file from the computer's point of view and called
*standard output*. All general-purpose programming languages
allow reading from standard input and
writing to standard output. This reading and writing can be done with
two types of tools, either file-like objects or special tools like
`raw_input`
and `print` in Python.
We will here describe the file-line objects:
`sys.stdin` for standard input
and `sys.stdout` for standard output. These objects
behave as file objects, except that they do not need to be opened or
closed. The statement

!bc pycod
s = raw_input('Give s:')
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = sys.stdin.readline()
!ec
Recall that the trailing comma in the `print` statement avoids the
newline that `print` by default adds to the output string.
Similarly,

!bc pycod
s = eval(raw_input('Give s:'))
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = eval(sys.stdin.readline())
!ec
For output to the terminal window, the statement

!bc pycod
print s
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
sys.stdout.write(s + '\n')
!ec

Why it is handy to have access to standard input and output
as file objects can be illustrated by an example. Suppose you have a
function that reads data from a file object `infile`
and writes data to a file object `outfile`.
A sample function may take the form

!bc pycod
def x2f(infile, outfile, f):
    for line in infile:
        x = float(line)
        y = f(x)
        outfile.write('%g\n' % y)
!ec
This function works with all types of files, including
web pages as `infile` (see Section ref{sec:files:webtxt}).
With `sys.stdin` as `infile` and/or `sys.stdout`
as `outfile`, the `x2f` function also works with standard input
and/or standard output. Without `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`,
we would need different code, employing `raw_input`
and `print`,
to deal with standard input and output. Now we can write a single
function that deals with all file media in a unified way.

idx{standard error}
idx{`sys.stderr`}

There is also something called *standard error*.
Usually this is the terminal window, just as standard output, but
programs can distinguish between writing ordinary output to standard
output and error messages to standard error, and these output media
can be redirected to, e.g., files such that one can separate
error messages from ordinary output.
In Python, standard error is the file-like object `sys.stderr`.
A typical application of `sys.stderr` is to report errors:

!bc pycod
if x < 0:
    sys.stderr.write('Illegal value of x'); sys.exit(1)
!ec
This message to `sys.stderr` is an alternative to
`print` or raising an exception.

=== Redirecting standard input, output, and error ===

Standard output from a program `prog`
can be redirected to a file
`output` instead of the screen, by
using the greater than sign:

!bc sys
Terminal> prog > output
!ec
Here, `prog` can be any
program, including a Python program run as `python myprog.py`.
Similarly, output to the medium called *standard error*
can be redirected by

!bc sys
Terminal> prog &> output
!ec
For example, error messages are normally written to standard error, which
is exemplified in this little terminal session on a Unix machine:

!bc sys
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2 &> errors
Terminal> cat errors  # print the file errors
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
!ec
When the program reads from standard input (the keyboard),
we can equally well redirect
standard input to a file, say with name `raw_input`, such that
the program reads from this file rather than from the keyboard:

!bc sys
Terminal> prog < input
!ec
Combinations are also possible:

!bc sys
Terminal> prog < input > output
!ec

=== Note ===

The redirection of standard output, input, and error
does not work for Python programs executed with the `run`
command inside IPython, only when executed directly
in the operating system in a terminal window, or with the same
command prefixed with an exclamation mark in IPython.

\chapter*{Preface}
\markboth{Preface}{Preface}

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples
from mathematics and the natural sciences.  We have chosen to use the
Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive
power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax.  Python is easy to
learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer
programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good
language for doing mathematical computing.  It is easy to combine
Python with compiled languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, which are
widely used languages for scientific computations.  A seamless
integration of Python with Java is offered by a special version of
Python called Jython.

The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to
mathematics, physics, biology, and finance.  The reader is expected to
have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in
mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an
advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably
containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus.  Although
not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many
of the examples more meaningful.

Many introductory programming books are quite compact and focus on
listing functionality of a programming language. However, learning to
program is learning how to \emph{think} as a programmer.  This book
has its main focus on the thinking process, or equivalently:
programming as a problem solving technique. That is why most of the
pages are devoted to case studies in programming, where we define a
problem and explain how to create the corresponding program.  New
constructions and programming styles (what we could call theory) is also usually
introduced via examples.  Special attention is paid to verification of
programs and to finding errors. These topics are very demanding for
mathematical software, because the unavoidable numerical
approximation errors are possibly mixed with programming mistakes.

By studying the many examples in the
book, I hope readers will learn how to think right and thereby
write programs in a quicker and more reliable way. Remember, nobody can learn
programming by just reading - one has to solve a large amount of
exercises hands on.  The book is therefore full of exercises of
various types: modifications of existing examples, completely new
problems, or debugging of given programs.

There is a web page associated with this book, \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}{\nolinkurl{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}, which lists the software you
need and explains briefly how to install it.  This page also contains
all the files associated with the program examples in this book.

\paragraph{Python version 2 or 3?}
A common problem among Python programmers is to choose between version
2 or 3, which at the time of this writing means choosing
between version 2.7 and 3.3.
The general recommendation is to go for version 3, but programs are
then not compatible with version 2 and vice versa. There is still
a problem that much useful mathematical software in Python
has not yet been ported to version 3. Therefore, scientific computing
with Python still goes mostly with version 2.
A widely used strategy for software
developers who want to write Python code that works with both versions,
is to develop for v2.7, which is very close to what is accepted
in version 3, and then
use the ranslation tool \emph{2to3} to automatically translate the code
to version 3.

When using v2.7, one should employ the newest syntax
and modules that make the differences beween version 2 and 3 very small.
This strategy is adopted in the present book. Only two
differences between versions 2 and 3 are expected to be significant for
the programs in the book:
\Verb!a/b! implies float division in version 3 if \Verb!a! and \Verb!b!
are integers,
and \Verb!print 'Hello'! in version 2 must be turned into a function call
\Verb!print('Hello')! in version 3. None of these differences should lead
to any annoying problems when future readers study the book's v2.7
examples, but program in version 3. Anyway, running 2to3 on the
example files generates the corresponding version 3 code.

\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}
Several people have helped to make substantial improvements of the
text. Here I list only the names with Norwgian characters to
test the handling of those: Ståle Zerener Haugnæss,
Tobias Vidarssønn Langhoff, and Håkon Møller.

\chapter{Basic array computing and plotting}

This chapter gives an introduction to arrays: how they are created
and what they can be used for.  Array computing usually ends up with a
lot of numbers. It may be very hard to understand what these numbers
mean by just looking at them. Since the human is a visual animal, a
good way to understand numbers is to visualize them. In this
chapter we concentrate on visualizing curves that reflect functions
of one variable; i.e., curves of the form $y=f(x)$.  A synonym for
curve is graph, and the image of curves on the screen is often called
a plot.  We will use arrays to store the information about points
along the curve. In a nutshell, array computing demands visualization
and visualization demands arrays.

All program examples in this chapter can be found as files in the
folder \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}{\nolinkurl{src/plot}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}}.

\section{Arrays in Python programs}

This section introduces array programming in Python, but first we
create some lists and show how arrays differ from lists.

\subsection{Using lists for collecting function data}
\label{sec:plot:listdata}

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ and want to evaluate this function
at a number of $x$ points $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.  We could collect
the $n$ pairs $(x_i,f(x_i))$ in a list, or we could collect all the
$x_i$ values, for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, in a list and all the associated
$f(x_i)$ values in another list.  The following interactive session
demonstrates how to create these three types of lists:

\bpy
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**3       # sample function
...
>>> n = 5                 # no of points along the x axis
>>> dx = 1.0/(n-1)        # spacing between x points in [0,1]
>>> xlist = [i*dx for i in range(n)]
>>> ylist = [f(x) for x in xlist]
>>> pairs = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist)]
\epy
Here we have used list comprehensions for achieving compact code. Make
sure that you understand what is going on in these list comprehensions
(if not, try to write the same code using standard \Verb!for! loops and
appending new list elements in each pass of the loops).

\index{heterogeneous lists}

The list elements consist of objects of the same type: any element in
\Verb!pairs! is a list of two \Verb!float! objects, while any element in \Verb!xlist!
or \Verb!ylist! is a \Verb!float!. Lists are more flexible than that, because an
element can be an object of any type, e.g.,

\bpycod
mylist = [2, 6.0, 'tmp.ps', [0,1]]
\epycod
Here \Verb!mylist! holds an \Verb!int!, a \Verb!float!, a string, and a list. This
combination of diverse object types makes up what is known as
\emph{heterogeneous} lists.  We can also easily remove elements from a list
or add new elements anywhere in the list.  This flexibility of lists
is in general convenient to have as a programmer, but in cases where
the elements are of the same type and the number of elements is fixed,
arrays can be used instead. The benefits of arrays are faster
computations, less memory demands, and extensive support for
mathematical operations on the data.  Because of greater efficiency
and mathematical convenience, arrays will be used to a large extent in
this book.  The great use of arrays is also prominent in other
programming environments such as MATLAB, Octave, and R, for instance.
Lists will be our choice instead of arrays when we need the
flexibility of adding or removing elements or when the elements may be
of different object types.

\subsection{Basics of numerical Python arrays}
\label{sec:plot:array:basics}

\index{Numerical Python} \index{NumPy} \index{numpy@{\rm\texttt{numpy}}}
\index{array (datatype)} \index{array computing}
\index{vectorization}

An \emph{array} object can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the
following assumptions and features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All elements must be of the same type, preferably integer, real, or complex numbers, for efficient numerical computing and storage.

  \item The number of elements must be known when the array is created.

  \item Arrays are not part of standard Python - one needs an additional package called \emph{Numerical Python}, often abbreviated as NumPy. The Python name of the package, to be used in \Verb!import! statements, is \Verb!numpy!.

  \item With \Verb!numpy!, a wide range of mathematical operations can be done directly on complete arrays, thereby removing the need for loops over array elements. This is commonly called \emph{vectorization} %or \emph{array computing} and may cause a dramatic speed-up of Python programs. Vectorization makes use of the vector computing concepts from Section~\ref{sec:plot:arraycomp}.

  \item Arrays with one index are often called vectors. Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. Arrays can also have three or more indices.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks]

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is actually an
   object type called \Verb!array! in standard Python, but this data type is
   not so efficient for mathematical computations, and we will not use it
   in this book.

\item The number of elements in an array \emph{can} be
   changed, but at a substantial computational cost.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



The following text lists some important functionality of NumPy arrays.
A more comprehensive treatment is found in the excellent \emph{NumPy
Tutorial}, \emph{NumPy User Guide}, \emph{NumPy Reference}, \emph{Guide to NumPy},
and \emph{NumPy for MATLAB Users}, all accessible at \href{{http://scipy.org}}{scipy.org}\footnote{\texttt{http://scipy.org}}.

\index{array@{\rm\texttt{array}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})} \index{np.array@{\rm\texttt{np.array}} function}
\index{np@{\rm\texttt{np}} prefix ({\rm\texttt{numpy}})}
\index{zeros\_like@{\rm\texttt{zeros\_like}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.zeros\_like@{\rm\texttt{np.zeros\_like}} function}



\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks on importing NumPy]
The statement

\bpycod
import numpy as np
\epycod
with subsequent prefixing of all NumPy functions and variables by \Verb!np.!,
has evolved as a standard syntax in the Python scientific computing
community. However, to make Python programs look closer to MATLAB
and ease the transition to and from that language, one can do

\bpycod
from numpy import *
\epycod
to get rid of the prefix (this is evolved as the standard in
\emph{interactive} Python shells). This author prefers mathematical
functions from \Verb!numpy! to be written without the prefix to
make the formulas as close as possible to the mathematics.
So, $f(x)=\sinh(x-1)\sin(w t)$ would be coded as

\bpycod
from numpy import sinh, sin

def f(x):
    return sinh(x-1)*sin(w*t)
\epycod
or one may take the less recommended
lazy approach \Verb!from numpy import *! and fill up
the program with \emph{a lot} of functions and variables from \Verb!numpy!.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



To convert a list \Verb!r! to an array,
we use the \Verb!array! function
from \Verb!numpy!:

\bpycod
a = np.array(r)
\epycod
To create a new array of length \Verb!n!, filled with zeros, we write

\bpycod
a = np.zeros(n)
\epycod
The array elements are of a type that corresponds to Python's
\Verb!float! type. A second argument to \Verb!np.zeros! can be used to
specify other element types, e.g., \Verb!int!.
A similar function,

\bpycod
a = np.zeros_like(c)
\epycod
generates an array of zeros where the length is that of the array \Verb!c!
and the element type is the same as those in \Verb!c!.  Arrays with more
than one index are treated in Section~\ref{sec:plot:2Darrays}.

\index{linspace@{\rm\texttt{linspace}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.linspace@{\rm\texttt{np.linspace}} function}

Often one wants an array to have $n$ elements with uniformly
distributed values in an interval $[p,q]$. The \Verb!numpy! function
\Verb!linspace! creates such arrays:

\bpycod
a = np.linspace(p, q, n)
\epycod

\section{Writing data to file}
\label{sec:files:writing}

Writing data to file is easy.
There is basically one function to pay attention to: \Verb!outfile.write(s)!,
which writes a string \Verb!s! to
a file handled by the file object \Verb!outfile!. Unlike \Verb!print!,
\Verb!outfile.write(s)!
does not append a newline character to the written string.
It will therefore
often be necessary to add a newline character,

\bpycod
outfile.write(s + '\n')
\epycod
if the string \Verb!s! is meant to appear on a single line in the file
and \Verb!s! does not already contain a trailing newline character.
File writing is then a matter of constructing strings containing the
text we want to have in the file and for each such string call
\Verb!outfile.write!.

Writing to a file demands
the file object \Verb!f!
to be opened for writing:

\bpycod
# write to new file, or overwrite file:
outfile = open(filename, 'w')

# append to the end of an existing file:
outfile = open(filename, 'a')
\epycod

\subsection{Example: Writing a table to file}

\paragraph{Problem.}
As a worked example of file writing,
we shall write out a nested list with tabular data to file.
A sample list may take look as

\bccq
[[ 0.75,        0.29619813, -0.29619813, -0.75      ],
 [ 0.29619813,  0.11697778, -0.11697778, -0.29619813],
 [-0.29619813, -0.11697778,  0.11697778,  0.29619813],
 [-0.75,       -0.29619813,  0.29619813,  0.75      ]]
\eccq

\paragraph{Solution.}
We iterate through the rows (first index) in the list, and for each row,
we iterate through the column values (second index)
and write each value to the file.
At the end of each row, we must insert a newline character in the file to get
a linebreak. The code resides in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}{\nolinkurl{write1.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}}.

The resulting data file becomes

\bdat
    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\edat

An extension of this program consists in adding column and row headings:

\bdat
           column  1     column  2     column  3     column  4
row  1    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
row  2    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
row  3   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
row  4   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\edat
To obtain this end result, we need to the add some statements to
the program \Verb!write1.py!. For the column headings we need
to know the number of columns, i.e., the length of the rows,
and loop from 1 to this length:

\bpycod
ncolumns = len(data[0])
outfile.write('          ')
for i in range(1, ncolumns+1):
    outfile.write('%10s    ' % ('column %2d' % i))
outfile.write('\n')
\epycod
Note the use of a nested printf construction: The text we want to
insert is itself a printf string. We could also have written the
text as \Verb!'column  ' + str(i)!, but then the length of the
resulting string would depend on the number of digits in \Verb!i!.
It is recommended to always use printf constructions for
a tabular output format, because this gives automatic padding of
blanks so that the width of the output strings remain the same.
As always, the tuning of the widths is done in a trial-and-error
process.

To add the row headings, we need a counter over the row numbers:

\bpycod
row_counter = 1
for row in data:
    outfile.write('row %2d' % row_counter)
    for column in row:
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % column)
    outfile.write('\n')
    row_counter += 1
\epycod
The complete code is found in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}{\nolinkurl{write2.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}}.
We could, alternatively, iterate over the indices in the list:

\bpycod
for i in range(len(data)):
    outfile.write('row %2d' % (i+1))
    for j in range(len(data[i])):
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % data[i][j])
    outfile.write('\n')
\epycod

\subsection{Standard input and output as file objects}

\index{standard input} \index{standard output}

\index{sys.stdin@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdin}}}\index{sys.stdout@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdout}}}

Reading user input from the keyboard applies the function
\Verb!raw_input! as explained in Section~\ref{sec:input:rawinput}.
The keyboard is a medium that the computer in fact
treats as a file, referred to
as \emph{standard input}.

The \Verb!print! command prints text in the terminal window. This medium
is also viewed as a file from the computer's point of view and called
\emph{standard output}. All general-purpose programming languages
allow reading from standard input and
writing to standard output. This reading and writing can be done with
two types of tools, either file-like objects or special tools like
\Verb!raw_input!
and \Verb!print! in Python.
We will here describe the file-line objects:
\Verb!sys.stdin! for standard input
and \Verb!sys.stdout! for standard output. These objects
behave as file objects, except that they do not need to be opened or
closed. The statement

\bpycod
s = raw_input('Give s:')
\epycod
is equivalent to

\bpycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = sys.stdin.readline()
\epycod
Recall that the trailing comma in the \Verb!print! statement avoids the
newline that \Verb!print! by default adds to the output string.
Similarly,

\bpycod
s = eval(raw_input('Give s:'))
\epycod
is equivalent to

\bpycod
print 'Give s: ',
s = eval(sys.stdin.readline())
\epycod
For output to the terminal window, the statement

\bpycod
print s
\epycod
is equivalent to

\bpycod
sys.stdout.write(s + '\n')
\epycod

Why it is handy to have access to standard input and output
as file objects can be illustrated by an example. Suppose you have a
function that reads data from a file object \Verb!infile!
and writes data to a file object \Verb!outfile!.
A sample function may take the form

\bpycod
def x2f(infile, outfile, f):
    for line in infile:
        x = float(line)
        y = f(x)
        outfile.write('%g\n' % y)
\epycod
This function works with all types of files, including
web pages as \Verb!infile! (see Section~\ref{sec:files:webtxt}).
With \Verb!sys.stdin! as \Verb!infile! and/or \Verb!sys.stdout!
as \Verb!outfile!, the \Verb!x2f! function also works with standard input
and/or standard output. Without \Verb!sys.stdin! and \Verb!sys.stdout!,
we would need different code, employing \Verb!raw_input!
and \Verb!print!,
to deal with standard input and output. Now we can write a single
function that deals with all file media in a unified way.

\index{standard error}
\index{sys.stderr@{\rm\texttt{sys.stderr}}}

There is also something called \emph{standard error}.
Usually this is the terminal window, just as standard output, but
programs can distinguish between writing ordinary output to standard
output and error messages to standard error, and these output media
can be redirected to, e.g., files such that one can separate
error messages from ordinary output.
In Python, standard error is the file-like object \Verb!sys.stderr!.
A typical application of \Verb!sys.stderr! is to report errors:

\bpycod
if x < 0:
    sys.stderr.write('Illegal value of x'); sys.exit(1)
\epycod
This message to \Verb!sys.stderr! is an alternative to
\Verb!print! or raising an exception.

\paragraph{Redirecting standard input, output, and error.}
Standard output from a program \Verb!prog!
can be redirected to a file
\Verb!output! instead of the screen, by
using the greater than sign:

\bsys
Terminal> prog > output
\esys
Here, \Verb!prog! can be any
program, including a Python program run as \Verb!python myprog.py!.
Similarly, output to the medium called \emph{standard error}
can be redirected by

\bsys
Terminal> prog &> output
\esys
For example, error messages are normally written to standard error, which
is exemplified in this little terminal session on a Unix machine:

\bsys
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2 &> errors
Terminal> cat errors  # print the file errors
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
\esys
When the program reads from standard input (the keyboard),
we can equally well redirect
standard input to a file, say with name \Verb!raw_input!, such that
the program reads from this file rather than from the keyboard:

\bsys
Terminal> prog < input
\esys
Combinations are also possible:

\bsys
Terminal> prog < input > output
\esys

\paragraph{Note.}
The redirection of standard output, input, and error
does not work for Python programs executed with the \Verb!run!
command inside IPython, only when executed directly
in the operating system in a terminal window, or with the same
command prefixed with an exclamation mark in IPython.

\paragraph{References.}
To check the bibliography, we need to make citations to a book{TCSE3},
Matplotlib \cite{Matplotlib:paper}, and more books \cite{Mertz,PythonQt}
as well as Python itself \cite{Python}, and of course NumPy
\cite{NumPy}.

\chapter*{Preface}
\markboth{Preface}{Preface}

The aim of this book is to teach computer programming using examples
from mathematics and the natural sciences.  We have chosen to use the
Python programming language because it combines remarkable expressive
power with very clean, simple, and compact syntax.  Python is easy to
learn and very well suited for an introduction to computer
programming. Python is also quite similar to MATLAB and a good
language for doing mathematical computing.  It is easy to combine
Python with compiled languages, like Fortran, C, and C++, which are
widely used languages for scientific computations.  A seamless
integration of Python with Java is offered by a special version of
Python called Jython.

The examples in this book integrate programming with applications to
mathematics, physics, biology, and finance.  The reader is expected to
have knowledge of basic one-variable calculus as taught in
mathematics-intensive programs in high schools. It is certainly an
advantage to take a university calculus course in parallel, preferably
containing both classical and numerical aspects of calculus.  Although
not strictly required, a background in high school physics makes many
of the examples more meaningful.

Many introductory programming books are quite compact and focus on
listing functionality of a programming language. However, learning to
program is learning how to \emph{think} as a programmer.  This book
has its main focus on the thinking process, or equivalently:
programming as a problem solving technique. That is why most of the
pages are devoted to case studies in programming, where we define a
problem and explain how to create the corresponding program.  New
constructions and programming styles (what we could call theory) is also usually
introduced via examples.  Special attention is paid to verification of
programs and to finding errors. These topics are very demanding for
mathematical software, because the unavoidable numerical
approximation errors are possibly mixed with programming mistakes.

By studying the many examples in the
book, I hope readers will learn how to think right and thereby
write programs in a quicker and more reliable way. Remember, nobody can learn
programming by just reading - one has to solve a large amount of
exercises hands on.  The book is therefore full of exercises of
various types: modifications of existing examples, completely new
problems, or debugging of given programs.

There is a web page associated with this book, \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}{\nolinkurl{http://hplgit.github.com/scipro-primer}}, which lists the software you
need and explains briefly how to install it.  This page also contains
all the files associated with the program examples in this book.

\paragraph{Python version 2 or 3?}
A common problem among Python programmers is to choose between version
2 or 3, which at the time of this writing means choosing
between version 2.7 and 3.3.
The general recommendation is to go for version 3, but programs are
then not compatible with version 2 and vice versa. There is still
a problem that much useful mathematical software in Python
has not yet been ported to version 3. Therefore, scientific computing
with Python still goes mostly with version 2.
A widely used strategy for software
developers who want to write Python code that works with both versions,
is to develop for v2.7, which is very close to what is accepted
in version 3, and then
use the ranslation tool \emph{2to3} to automatically translate the code
to version 3.

When using v2.7, one should employ the newest syntax
and modules that make the differences beween version 2 and 3 very small.
This strategy is adopted in the present book. Only two
differences between versions 2 and 3 are expected to be significant for
the programs in the book:
\Verb!a/b! implies float division in version 3 if \Verb!a! and \Verb!b!
are integers,
and \Verb!print 'Hello'! in version 2 must be turned into a function call
\Verb!print('Hello')! in version 3. None of these differences should lead
to any annoying problems when future readers study the book's v2.7
examples, but program in version 3. Anyway, running 2to3 on the
example files generates the corresponding version 3 code.

\paragraph{Acknowledgments.}
Several people have helped to make substantial improvements of the
text. Here I list only the names with Norwgian characters to
test the handling of those: Ståle Zerener Haugnæss,
Tobias Vidarssønn Langhoff, and Håkon Møller.

\chapter{Basic array computing and plotting}

This chapter gives an introduction to arrays: how they are created
and what they can be used for.  Array computing usually ends up with a
lot of numbers. It may be very hard to understand what these numbers
mean by just looking at them. Since the human is a visual animal, a
good way to understand numbers is to visualize them. In this
chapter we concentrate on visualizing curves that reflect functions
of one variable; i.e., curves of the form $y=f(x)$.  A synonym for
curve is graph, and the image of curves on the screen is often called
a plot.  We will use arrays to store the information about points
along the curve. In a nutshell, array computing demands visualization
and visualization demands arrays.

All program examples in this chapter can be found as files in the
folder \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}{\nolinkurl{src/plot}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/plot}}}.

\section{Arrays in Python programs}

This section introduces array programming in Python, but first we
create some lists and show how arrays differ from lists.

\subsection{Using lists for collecting function data}
\label{sec:plot:listdata}

Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ and want to evaluate this function
at a number of $x$ points $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}$.  We could collect
the $n$ pairs $(x_i,f(x_i))$ in a list, or we could collect all the
$x_i$ values, for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, in a list and all the associated
$f(x_i)$ values in another list.  The following interactive session
demonstrates how to create these three types of lists:

\providecommand{\shadedskip}{}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.87843, 0.95686, 1.0}
\renewenvironment{shadedskip}{
\def\FrameCommand{\colorbox{shadecolor}}\FrameRule0.6pt
\MakeFramed {\FrameRestore}\vskip3mm}{\vskip0mm\endMakeFramed}
\providecommand{\shadedquoteBlue}{}
\renewenvironment{shadedquoteBlue}[1][]{
\bgroup\rmfamily
\fboxsep=0mm\relax
\begin{shadedskip}
\list{}{\parsep=-2mm\parskip=0mm\topsep=0pt\leftmargin=2mm
\rightmargin=2\leftmargin\leftmargin=4pt\relax}
\item\relax}
{\endlist\end{shadedskip}\egroup}\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
>>> def f(x):
...     return x**3       # sample function
...
>>> n = 5                 # no of points along the x axis
>>> dx = 1.0/(n-1)        # spacing between x points in [0,1]
>>> xlist = [i*dx for i in range(n)]
>>> ylist = [f(x) for x in xlist]
>>> pairs = [[x, y] for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist)]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Here we have used list comprehensions for achieving compact code. Make
sure that you understand what is going on in these list comprehensions
(if not, try to write the same code using standard \Verb!for! loops and
appending new list elements in each pass of the loops).

\index{heterogeneous lists}

The list elements consist of objects of the same type: any element in
\Verb!pairs! is a list of two \Verb!float! objects, while any element in \Verb!xlist!
or \Verb!ylist! is a \Verb!float!. Lists are more flexible than that, because an
element can be an object of any type, e.g.,

\providecommand{\shadedskip}{}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.87843, 0.95686, 1.0}
\renewenvironment{shadedskip}{
\def\FrameCommand{\colorbox{shadecolor}}\FrameRule0.6pt
\MakeFramed {\FrameRestore}\vskip3mm}{\vskip0mm\endMakeFramed}
\providecommand{\shadedquoteBlue}{}
\renewenvironment{shadedquoteBlue}[1][]{
\bgroup\rmfamily
\fboxsep=0mm\relax
\begin{shadedskip}
\list{}{\parsep=-2mm\parskip=0mm\topsep=0pt\leftmargin=2mm
\rightmargin=2\leftmargin\leftmargin=4pt\relax}
\item\relax}
{\endlist\end{shadedskip}\egroup}\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
mylist = [2, 6.0, 'tmp.ps', [0,1]]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Here \Verb!mylist! holds an \Verb!int!, a \Verb!float!, a string, and a list. This
combination of diverse object types makes up what is known as
\emph{heterogeneous} lists.  We can also easily remove elements from a list
or add new elements anywhere in the list.  This flexibility of lists
is in general convenient to have as a programmer, but in cases where
the elements are of the same type and the number of elements is fixed,
arrays can be used instead. The benefits of arrays are faster
computations, less memory demands, and extensive support for
mathematical operations on the data.  Because of greater efficiency
and mathematical convenience, arrays will be used to a large extent in
this book.  The great use of arrays is also prominent in other
programming environments such as MATLAB, Octave, and R, for instance.
Lists will be our choice instead of arrays when we need the
flexibility of adding or removing elements or when the elements may be
of different object types.

\subsection{Basics of numerical Python arrays}
\label{sec:plot:array:basics}

\index{Numerical Python} \index{NumPy} \index{numpy@{\rm\texttt{numpy}}}
\index{array (datatype)} \index{array computing}
\index{vectorization}

An \emph{array} object can be viewed as a variant of a list, but with the
following assumptions and features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All elements must be of the same type, preferably integer, real, or complex numbers, for efficient numerical computing and storage.

  \item The number of elements must be known when the array is created.

  \item Arrays are not part of standard Python - one needs an additional package called \emph{Numerical Python}, often abbreviated as NumPy. The Python name of the package, to be used in \Verb!import! statements, is \Verb!numpy!.

  \item With \Verb!numpy!, a wide range of mathematical operations can be done directly on complete arrays, thereby removing the need for loops over array elements. This is commonly called \emph{vectorization} %or \emph{array computing} and may cause a dramatic speed-up of Python programs. Vectorization makes use of the vector computing concepts from Section~\ref{sec:plot:arraycomp}.

  \item Arrays with one index are often called vectors. Arrays with two indices are used as an efficient data structure for tables, instead of lists of lists. Arrays can also have three or more indices.
\end{itemize}

\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks]

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is actually an
   object type called \Verb!array! in standard Python, but this data type is
   not so efficient for mathematical computations, and we will not use it
   in this book.

\item The number of elements in an array \emph{can} be
   changed, but at a substantial computational cost.

The following text lists some important functionality of NumPy arrays.
A more comprehensive treatment is found in the excellent \emph{NumPy
Tutorial}, \emph{NumPy User Guide}, \emph{NumPy Reference}, \emph{Guide to NumPy},
and \emph{NumPy for MATLAB Users}, all accessible at \href{{http://scipy.org}}{scipy.org}\footnote{\texttt{http://scipy.org}}.

\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Remarks on importing NumPy]
The statement

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
import numpy as np
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
with subsequent prefixing of all NumPy functions and variables by \Verb!np.!,
has evolved as a standard syntax in the Python scientific computing
community. However, to make Python programs look closer to MATLAB
and ease the transition to and from that language, one can do

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
from numpy import *
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
to get rid of the prefix (this is evolved as the standard in
\emph{interactive} Python shells). This author prefers mathematical
functions from \Verb!numpy! to be written without the prefix to
make the formulas as close as possible to the mathematics.
So, $f(x)=\sinh(x-1)\sin(w t)$ would be coded as

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
from numpy import sinh, sin

def f(x):
    return sinh(x-1)*sin(w*t)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
or one may take the less recommended
lazy approach \Verb!from numpy import *! and fill up
the program with \emph{a lot} of functions and variables from \Verb!numpy!.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



To convert a list \Verb!r! to an array,
we use the \Verb!array! function
from \Verb!numpy!:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.array(r)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
To create a new array of length \Verb!n!, filled with zeros, we write

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.zeros(n)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
The array elements are of a type that corresponds to Python's
\Verb!float! type. A second argument to \Verb!np.zeros! can be used to
specify other element types, e.g., \Verb!int!.
A similar function,

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.zeros_like(c)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
generates an array of zeros where the length is that of the array \Verb!c!
and the element type is the same as those in \Verb!c!.  Arrays with more
than one index are treated in Section~\ref{sec:plot:2Darrays}.

\index{linspace@{\rm\texttt{linspace}} (from {\rm\texttt{numpy}})}\index{np.linspace@{\rm\texttt{np.linspace}} function}

Often one wants an array to have $n$ elements with uniformly
distributed values in an interval $[p,q]$. The \Verb!numpy! function
\Verb!linspace! creates such arrays:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = np.linspace(p, q, n)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}

\section{Writing data to file}
\label{sec:files:writing}

Writing data to file is easy.
There is basically one function to pay attention to: \Verb!outfile.write(s)!,
which writes a string \Verb!s! to
a file handled by the file object \Verb!outfile!. Unlike \Verb!print!,
\Verb!outfile.write(s)!
does not append a newline character to the written string.
It will therefore
often be necessary to add a newline character,

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
outfile.write(s + '\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
if the string \Verb!s! is meant to appear on a single line in the file
and \Verb!s! does not already contain a trailing newline character.
File writing is then a matter of constructing strings containing the
text we want to have in the file and for each such string call
\Verb!outfile.write!.

Writing to a file demands
the file object \Verb!f!
to be opened for writing:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
# write to new file, or overwrite file:
outfile = open(filename, 'w')

# append to the end of an existing file:
outfile = open(filename, 'a')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent

\subsection{Example: Writing a table to file}

\paragraph{Problem.}
As a worked example of file writing,
we shall write out a nested list with tabular data to file.
A sample list may take look as

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
[[ 0.75,        0.29619813, -0.29619813, -0.75      ],
 [ 0.29619813,  0.11697778, -0.11697778, -0.29619813],
 [-0.29619813, -0.11697778,  0.11697778,  0.29619813],
 [-0.75,       -0.29619813,  0.29619813,  0.75      ]]
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{Solution.}
We iterate through the rows (first index) in the list, and for each row,
we iterate through the column values (second index)
and write each value to the file.
At the end of each row, we must insert a newline character in the file to get
a linebreak. The code resides in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}{\nolinkurl{write1.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write1.py}}}.

The resulting data file becomes

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

An extension of this program consists in adding column and row headings:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
           column  1     column  2     column  3     column  4
row  1    0.75000000    0.29619813   -0.29619813   -0.75000000
row  2    0.29619813    0.11697778   -0.11697778   -0.29619813
row  3   -0.29619813   -0.11697778    0.11697778    0.29619813
row  4   -0.75000000   -0.29619813    0.29619813    0.75000000
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
To obtain this end result, we need to the add some statements to
the program \Verb!write1.py!. For the column headings we need
to know the number of columns, i.e., the length of the rows,
and loop from 1 to this length:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
ncolumns = len(data[0])
outfile.write('          ')
for i in range(1, ncolumns+1):
    outfile.write('%10s    ' % ('column %2d' % i))
outfile.write('\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Note the use of a nested printf construction: The text we want to
insert is itself a printf string. We could also have written the
text as \Verb!'column  ' + str(i)!, but then the length of the
resulting string would depend on the number of digits in \Verb!i!.
It is recommended to always use printf constructions for
a tabular output format, because this gives automatic padding of
blanks so that the width of the output strings remain the same.
As always, the tuning of the widths is done in a trial-and-error
process.

To add the row headings, we need a counter over the row numbers:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
row_counter = 1
for row in data:
    outfile.write('row %2d' % row_counter)
    for column in row:
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % column)
    outfile.write('\n')
    row_counter += 1
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
The complete code is found in the file \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}{\nolinkurl{write2.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/write2.py}}}.
We could, alternatively, iterate over the indices in the list:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
for i in range(len(data)):
    outfile.write('row %2d' % (i+1))
    for j in range(len(data[i])):
        outfile.write('%14.8f' % data[i][j])
    outfile.write('\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Some other files and URLs we can mention, just to test a 2-digit footnote,
are

\begin{itemize}
 \item \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall.py}}{\nolinkurl{addall.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall.py}}}

 \item \href{{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall_v1.py}}{\nolinkurl{addall_v1.py}\footnote{\texttt{http://some.where.net/doconce/test/software/input/addall\_v1.py}}}

\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Standard input and output as file objects}

\index{standard input} \index{standard output}

\index{sys.stdin@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdin}}}\index{sys.stdout@{\rm\texttt{sys.stdout}}}

Reading user input from the keyboard applies the function
\Verb!raw_input! as explained in Section~\ref{sec:input:rawinput}.
The keyboard is a medium that the computer in fact
treats as a file, referred to
as \emph{standard input}.

The \Verb!print! command prints text in the terminal window. This medium
is also viewed as a file from the computer's point of view and called
\emph{standard output}. All general-purpose programming languages
allow reading from standard input and
writing to standard output. This reading and writing can be done with
two types of tools, either file-like objects or special tools like
\Verb!raw_input!
and \Verb!print! in Python.
We will here describe the file-line objects:
\Verb!sys.stdin! for standard input
and \Verb!sys.stdout! for standard output. These objects
behave as file objects, except that they do not need to be opened or
closed. The statement

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
s = raw_input('Give s:')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
is equivalent to

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
print 'Give s: ',
s = sys.stdin.readline()
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
Recall that the trailing comma in the \Verb!print! statement avoids the
newline that \Verb!print! by default adds to the output string.
Similarly,

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
s = eval(raw_input('Give s:'))
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
is equivalent to

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
print 'Give s: ',
s = eval(sys.stdin.readline())
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
For output to the terminal window, the statement

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
print s
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
is equivalent to

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
sys.stdout.write(s + '\n')
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent

Why it is handy to have access to standard input and output
as file objects can be illustrated by an example. Suppose you have a
function that reads data from a file object \Verb!infile!
and writes data to a file object \Verb!outfile!.
A sample function may take the form

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
def x2f(infile, outfile, f):
    for line in infile:
        x = float(line)
        y = f(x)
        outfile.write('%g\n' % y)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
This function works with all types of files, including
web pages as \Verb!infile! (see Section~\ref{sec:files:webtxt}).
With \Verb!sys.stdin! as \Verb!infile! and/or \Verb!sys.stdout!
as \Verb!outfile!, the \Verb!x2f! function also works with standard input
and/or standard output. Without \Verb!sys.stdin! and \Verb!sys.stdout!,
we would need different code, employing \Verb!raw_input!
and \Verb!print!,
to deal with standard input and output. Now we can write a single
function that deals with all file media in a unified way.

\index{standard error}
\index{sys.stderr@{\rm\texttt{sys.stderr}}}

There is also something called \emph{standard error}.
Usually this is the terminal window, just as standard output, but
programs can distinguish between writing ordinary output to standard
output and error messages to standard error, and these output media
can be redirected to, e.g., files such that one can separate
error messages from ordinary output.
In Python, standard error is the file-like object \Verb!sys.stderr!.
A typical application of \Verb!sys.stderr! is to report errors:

\begin{shadedquoteBlue}
\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}
\begin{Verbatim}
if x < 0:
    sys.stderr.write('Illegal value of x'); sys.exit(1)
\end{Verbatim}
\end{shadedquoteBlue}
\noindent
This message to \Verb!sys.stderr! is an alternative to
\Verb!print! or raising an exception.

\paragraph{Redirecting standard input, output, and error.}
Standard output from a program \Verb!prog!
can be redirected to a file
\Verb!output! instead of the screen, by
using the greater than sign:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog > output
\end{Verbatim}
Here, \Verb!prog! can be any
program, including a Python program run as \Verb!python myprog.py!.
Similarly, output to the medium called \emph{standard error}
can be redirected by

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog &> output
\end{Verbatim}
For example, error messages are normally written to standard error, which
is exemplified in this little terminal session on a Unix machine:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
Terminal> ls bla-bla1 bla-bla2 &> errors
Terminal> cat errors  # print the file errors
ls: cannot access bla-bla1: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access bla-bla2: No such file or directory
\end{Verbatim}
When the program reads from standard input (the keyboard),
we can equally well redirect
standard input to a file, say with name \Verb!raw_input!, such that
the program reads from this file rather than from the keyboard:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog < input
\end{Verbatim}
Combinations are also possible:

\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> prog < input > output
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Note.}
The redirection of standard output, input, and error
does not work for Python programs executed with the \Verb!run!
command inside IPython, only when executed directly
in the operating system in a terminal window, or with the same
command prefixed with an exclamation mark in IPython.

\paragraph{References.}
To check the bibliography, we need to make citations to a book{TCSE3},
Matplotlib \cite{Matplotlib:paper}, and more books \cite{Mertz,PythonQt}
as well as Python itself \cite{Python}, and of course NumPy
\cite{NumPy}.

Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html_style=bootswatch --html_admon=bootstrap_panel
!ec

Here goes optional text.

# A split before the first section will enable a button in the jumbotron
# for going to the first real page

!split
========= More details on writing DocOnce documents with Bootstrap layout =========


======= Demonstrations of admons =======

The Bootstrap/Bootswatch styles support two kinds of admons:

 * alert admons (`bootstrap_alert`) with colored background (default)
 * panel admon (`bootstrap_panel`) where only the title has colored background


Below are some examples on admons.

!bquestion Testing the understanding
How many admon styles are supported by the DocOnce Boostrap and Bootswatch
styles?
!equestion

!bsummary
DocOnce supports the following elements of Bootstrap elements:

 * Admons
 * Panels (via admons)
 * Jumbotron for title and intro
 * Columns of content (grid structure via the `slidecell` environment)
 * Tooltips via footnotes
!esummary

Tables, first with math headings:

|-l----r-------r--------r--|
|$i$|$h_i$|$\bar T_i$|`L_i`|
|-l-----r-------r----r-----|
|0   |0     |288   |-0.0065|

===== Principles of grid structures =====

The HTML page can feature a grid structure of cells, defined by
the following syntax in case of a 1x3 grid:

!bc
# begin-grid-area

|bslidecell 00
...
|eslidecell

|bslidecell 01
...
|eslidecell

|bslidecell 02
...
|eslidecell

# end-grid-area
!ec

===== Example on a 1x3 grid structure =====

# begin-grid-area

Some text like this is lost.

!bslidecell 00
__Mathematics.__
Given a function

!bt
\[ f(x) = e^{-ax}\sin wx\thinspace .\]
!et
Write a program for evaluating $f(x)$, and test the program
for the value of $f(0)$.
!eslidecell

!bslidecell 01
__Implementation.__
The Python implementation reads

!bc pycod
from math import exp, sin

def f(x):
    return exp(-a*x)*sin(w*x)
!ec
where `a` and `w` must be *global variables*, initialized in the
main program.
!eslidecell

!bslidecell 02

__Computational experiment.__
With a main program

!bc pycod
a = 1
from math import pi
w = pi
print f(0)
!ec
we can run the program:

!bc sys
Terminal> python prog.py
0
!ec
!eslidecell
# end-grid-area

===== Variation of the previous grid structure using panels =====

# Note: panels are realized as admons, using --admon_style=bootstrap_panel

# begin-grid-area

======= Test of Markdown input syntax in DocOnce =======

DocOnce can recognize basic Markdown as input in the `.do.txt` file
and transform such text to native DocOnce.

# DocOnce comments also start with #, and can be confused with
# Markdown headings. The confusion is avoided by not having blanks
# after the # character in single-line comments. Multi-line
# comments work well and are never confused with Markdown headings.

# Markdown applies standard HTML
# comments 

[hpl: This is a special comment on text that
is rendered by extended Markdown versions. ]

[comment:  This is another version of the special comment on text;
this one without any author name and colon in the beginning.
]

##Table of contents
TOC: on

===== Test of inline formatting =====

Markdown has _boldface_ and *emphasize* typesetting, as well
as `inline verbatim computer code`.

__Paragraph headings.__ These are written using standard Markdown
boldface syntax.

=== Subsubsection heading ===

The Markdown headings can only be of three types: section, subsection,
and subsubsection.

======= Typesetting of computer code =======

Here is a plain code snippet without language specification:

!bc
file=$1
if [ -f $file ]; then
  cp $file $file.cop
fi
# This is Bash - what happens to this comment?
!ec

The same snippet typeset explicitly as Bash:

!bc shcod

file=$1
if [ -f $file ]; then
  cp $file $file.cop
fi
# This is Bash - what happens to this comment?
!ec

And here is Python:

!bc pycod

from math import sin

def f(x):
    return x*sin(x)

x = 1.4
print f(x)
!ec

And HTML:

!bc htmlcod

<h1>Some heading</h1>
# And a comment 
!ec


======= Test of quoted sections =======

!bblock
Markdown also features quoted
paragraphs that start with a greater
than sign, either just in the beginning
or at every line.
!eblock

If a quoted paragraph with blank lines is desired, you
must use `>` on the beginning of every line.

!bblock
_NOTE_:

This quoted paragragraph is a simulation of a primitive
admon in Markdown.
!eblock

======= Test of lists =======

Markdown applies the dash in itemized lists:

 * This is item 1
 * This is item 2
 * This is item 3

Let us test this in a quoted environment too:

!bblock
_List_:
  * This is item 1
  * This is item 2, which cannot be split between lines
  * This is item 3
!eblock

Enumerated lists go as follows.

 o Item 1
 o Item 2
 o Item 3

======= Test of tables =======

_Markdown Extra_ has a special syntax for tables:


|-----------------------------|
| Item      |    Value | Qty  |
|---l-------r-------c---|
| Computer  | 1600 USD |  5   |
| Phone     |   12 USD |  12  |
| Pipe      |    1 USD | 234  |
|-----------------------------|
#Horizontal marker/rule

-------------------------

======= Test of mathematics =======

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using _MathJax_, as on "math.stackexchange.com": "http://math.stackexchange.com/":

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall
n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

!bt
\[ \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,. \]

text for section 1.

This is a *first* example of using the _DocWriter

It could be a nice tool since we do not need to bother
with special typesetting, such as `fixed width fonts`
in plain text.

__Test of a Paragraph.__ 
Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.
Here is an enumerate list:

  </ul> <!-- end of "itemize" list -->
</ul> <!-- end of "itemize" list -->
Here is some Python code:

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.item = 0  # create a new attribute

</pre>

<h1>Second Section</h1>
Here is a description list:
<dl> <!-- start of "description" list -->
<p><dt>keyword1</dt><dd> item1</dd>
<p><dt>keyword2</dt><dd> item2 goes here, with a colon : and some text after</dd>

  <dl> <!-- start of "description" list -->
    <p><dt>key3</dt><dd> subitem1</dd>
    <p><dt>key4</dt><dd> subitem2</dd>

<TITLE>Demo of Doconce formats</TITLE>
<H3>Doconce demo</H3>

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="$name.do.txt">$name.do.txt</a> is the source of the
Doconce $name, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html $name.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="$name.html">$name.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex $name.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="$name.tex">$name.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="$name.pdf">$name.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    $name.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx $name.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="$name.rst">$name.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="$name.xml">XML</a>, <a href="$name.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="$name.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,
and from LaTeX to <a href="$name.rst.pdf">PDF</a>.
The <a href="$name.sphinx.rst">Sphinx</a> dialect of reST
can be translated to <a href="$name.sphinx.pdf">PDF</a>
and <a href="html/index.html">HTML</a>.
<p>
Doconce can also be converted to
<a href="$name.gwiki">Googlecode wiki</a>,
<a href="$name.mwiki">MediaWiki</a>,
<a href="$name.cwiki">Creole wiki</a>,
<a href="$name.md">aPandoc</a>,
<a href="$name.st">Structured Text</a>,

TITLE: DocOnce Quick Reference
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
DATE: today
TOC: on

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

__Mission.__ Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

===== Supported Formats =====

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


===== Emacs syntax support =====

The file ".doconce-mode.el":
"https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el"
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Emacs key      | Action                                |
|----l-------------------------l-------------------------|
|  Ctrl+c f      | figure                                |
|  Ctrl+c v      | movie/video                           |
|  Ctrl+c h1     | heading level 1 (section/h1)          |
|  Ctrl+c h2     | heading level 2 (subsection/h2)       |
|  Ctrl+c h3     | heading level 2 (subsection/h3)       |
|  Ctrl+c hp     | heading for paragraph                 |
|  Ctrl+c me     | math environment: `!bt` equation `!et`|

|  Ctrl+c table3 | table with 3 columns                  |
|  Ctrl+c table4 | table with 4 columns                  |
|  Ctrl+c exer   | exercise outline                      |
|  Ctrl+c slide  | slide outline                         |
|  Ctrl+c help   | print this table                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|

===== Title, Authors, and Date =====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

!bc
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
!ec
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
!bc
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
!ec
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


===== Section Types =====
label{quick:sections}

|----------------c---------------------------c---------------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                                |
|----------------l---------------------------l---------------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)         |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)         |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)         |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)         |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)         |
| abstract                | `__Abstract.__` Running text...              |
| appendix                | `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| appendix                | `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
| exercise                | `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)  |
| exercise                | `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

===== Inline Formatting =====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text

!bc
`color{red}{two red words}`
!ec
becomes color{red}{two red words}.
% if FORMAT not in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html"):
(But colors do not work in format ${FORMAT}).
% endif

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

!bc
This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
!ec

A forced linebreak is specified by `<linebreak>` at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

!bc
Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
!ec

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

!bc
This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
!ec

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

!bc
---------
!ec

The `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html` formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: `---`. Here is an example:

!bc
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
!ec
This text is in the ${FORMAT} rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A & M, is written as a
plain `&` *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of `&`, as in `Texas A & M`, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A & M, while words on both sides of `&`, as in `Guns & Roses`,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after `&` will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the `html`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex` formats.

Emojis, as defined in URL: "http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com", can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) `:dizzy_face:` with blank or newline
before or after. Only the `pdflatex` and `html` output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
`--no_emoji` removes all emojis from the output document.

===== Lists =====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
!bc
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
!ec
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line


!bwarning No indentation - except in lists!
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.
!ewarning


===== Comment lines =====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


===== Inline comments =====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
!bc
[name: running text]
!ec
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, `+` and `-`, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

!bc
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
!ec
which is rendered as

!bquote
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
!equote

The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the `--latex_todonotes`
option to `doconce format`, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
`todonotes` package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
!ec
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
!bc sys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

!bc
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
[name: some text -> some replacement for text]
!ec

For example, the text

!bc
First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
!ec
can be edited as

!bc
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
!ec
which in the ${FORMAT} output format results in

!bquote
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
!equote

To implement these edits, run

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec

===== Verbatim/Computer Code =====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
!bc
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
!ec
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

!bc cod
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
!ec

# When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
# ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
!bc
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
!ec
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active for
`latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (`envir=shpro`) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (`shpro`) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to `!bc shcod`, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
!bc
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
!ec
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

!bc
|bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
|et
!ec
## Note: |bt and |et (and |bc and |ec below) are used to illustrate
## tex and code blocks in inside verbatim blocks and are replaced
## by !bt, !et, !bc, and !ec after all other formatting is finished.

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
Here is a single equation:

!bc
|bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
|et
!ec
which results in

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the `html`, `sphinx`,
   and `ipynb` formats.
 * Only five equation environments can be used: `\[ ... \]`,
   `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, and `align`.
 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   `newcommands*.tex`.
 * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

!bnotice
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (`subfigure` package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as `sphinx` and `html`, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using `doconce combine_images`),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
`.tex` produced by DocOnce.
!enotice

__LaTeX Newcommands.__
The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire `newcommand` outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).


===== Hyperlinks =====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

!bc
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
!ec

===== Figures and Movies =====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
!bc
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

!ec
Note three important syntax details:

  o A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
  o no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,
  o all of the command must appear on a single line,
  o there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
!bc sys
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
!ec
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

!ec
The latter results in

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.


===== Tables =====

The table in Section ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
!bc

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

!ec

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

!bc sys
Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt
!ec
Now we can do `# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"` in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in `mydata_table.do.txt`
into the DocOnce file.

===== Labels and References =====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
!bc
label{name}
!ec
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like `:` or `_` between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
!bc
ref{name}
!ec
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


===== Citations and Bibliography =====

Single citations are written as
!bc
cite{name}
!ec
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
!bc
cite{name1,name2,name3}
!ec

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
"Publish": "https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

===== Generalized References =====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

!bc do
ref[internal][cite][external]
!ec
with a specific example being

!bc do
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
!ec
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
references with `ref` in the text `internal` are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if `cite` is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex`, one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line
`# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal` followed by `cite`,
and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

===== Index of Keywords =====

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
!bc
index{name}
!ec
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

===== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` =====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

@@@CODE doconce_program.sh

===== Exercises =====

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
!bc
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

|bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
|ehint

|bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
|ehint
!ec
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

!bc
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
!ec
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

!bc
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

|bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

|bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
|eans

|bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
|ehint

|bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
|ehint
|esubex

|bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

|bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
|ehint

|bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
|esol
|esubex

|bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
|eremarks

|bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
|esol

!ec
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


===== Environments =====

DocOnce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide


===== Preprocessing =====

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, ``comment out'' a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

!bc
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
!ec

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "example document": "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

<b>WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!</b>

<p>
<b>Mission.</b>
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code <em>once, in one place</em> and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's <code>blogger.com</code>, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

<p>
</div> <!-- end jumbotron -->

<h2 id="___sec0">Supported Formats </h2>

<p>
DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>)</li>
 <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>)</li>
 <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>)</li>
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>)</li>
 <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>)</li>
 <li> IPython notebook (format <code>ipynb</code>)</li>
 <li> MediaWiki (format <code>mwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>)</li>
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>)</li>
 <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>)</li>
 <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)</li>
</ul>

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code>; and to a slightly
less extent <code>mwiki</code> and <code>pandoc</code>. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

<h2 id="___sec1">Emacs syntax support </h2>

<p>
The file <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el" target="_self">.doconce-mode.el</a>
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
<code>(load-file &quot;~/.doconce-mode.el&quot;)</code> to the <code>.emacs</code> file.

<p>
Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-8">
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><td align="center"><b>  Emacs key  </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                           Action                           </b></td> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c f         </td> <td align="left">   figure                                                          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c v         </td> <td align="left">   movie/video                                                     </td> </tr>

<h2 id="___sec2">Title, Authors, and Date </h2>

<p>
A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory &amp; Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 &amp; institution2
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the <code>&</code> keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword <code>and</code> works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

<p>
The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Jan 32, 2100</code>.

<p>
The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.

<h2 id="quick:sections">Section Types</h2>

<p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-9">
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed">
<thead>
<tr><td align="center"><b> Section type</b></td> <td align="center"><b>                              Syntax                             </b></td> </tr>

</tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div> <!-- col-xs-9 -->
<p>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> or
<code>__Summary.__</code> at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more <code>=</code> signs of the next heading.

<p>
The <code>Exercise:</code> keyword kan be substituted by <code>Problem:</code> or <code>Project:</code>.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

<h2 id="___sec4">Inline Formatting </h2>

<p>
Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
<em>emphasized words</em>. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> becomes <b>boldface</b>. Colored words
are also possible: the text

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>`color{red}{two red words}`
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.

<p>
Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
A forced linebreak is specified by <code>&lt;linebreak&gt;</code> at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

<p>
Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Differentiating[^diff2] \eqref{eq1} leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

<p>
<hr>

<p>
is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>---------
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code> formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: <code>---</code>. Here is an example:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
This text is in the html rendered as

<p>
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences&mdash;this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*&mdash; Donald Knuth.

<p>
An ampersand, as in Guns &amp; Roses or Texas A&amp;M, is written as a
plain <code>&</code> <em>with space(s) on both sides</em>. Single upper case letters on each
side of <code>&</code>, as in <code>Texas A & M</code>, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&amp;M, while words on both sides of <code>&</code>, as in <code>Guns & Roses</code>,
preserve the spaces: Guns &amp; Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after <code>&</code> will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the <code>html</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

<p>
Emojis, as defined in <a href="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com" target="_self"><tt>http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com</tt></a>, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) <code>:dizzy_face:</code> with blank or newline
before or after. Only the <code>pdflatex</code> and <code>html</code> output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
<code>--no_emoji</code> removes all emojis from the output document.

<h2 id="___sec5">Lists </h2>

<p>
There are three types of lists: <em>bullet lists</em>, where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, <em>enumeration lists</em>, where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consecutive numbers,
and <em>description</em> lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The code above follows.

<p>
Here is a bullet list:

<ul>
 <li> item1</li>
 <li> item2</li>

<ul>
  <li> subitem1 of item2</li>
  <li> subitem2 of item2</li>
</ul>

 <li> item3</li>
</ul>

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

<p>
Here is an enumeration list:

<ol>
<li> item1</li>
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines</li>

<ol>
 <li> subitem1 of item2</li>
 <li> subitem2 of item2</li>
</ol>

<li> item3</li>
</ol>

And finally a description list:

<p>

<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b>No indentation - except in lists!</b>
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec6">Comment lines </h2>

<p>
Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

<p>
Comment lines starting with <code>##</code> are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

<p>
Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
<code># #ifdef EXTRA</code> and <code># #endif</code> around the text. The command line
option <code>-DEXTRA</code> will bring the text alive again.

<p>
When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.

<h2 id="___sec7">Inline comments </h2>

<p>
Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>[name: running text]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
which is rendered as

<p>
<blockquote>
    Some running text. 
    <!-- begin inline comment -->
    <font color="red">(<b>hpl 1</b>: There must be a space after the colon, but the running text can occupy multiple lines.)</font>
    <!-- end inline comment -->
</blockquote>


<p>
The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the <code>--latex_todonotes</code>
option to <code>doconce format</code>, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
<code>todonotes</code> package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

<p>
Running
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

<p>
All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -&gt; some replacement for text]
[name: some text -&gt; some replacement for text]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
For example, the text

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q&gt;0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
can be edited as

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -&gt; the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q&gt;0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -&gt; properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
which in the html output format results in

<p>
<blockquote>
    First<font color="red">, (<b>edit 2</b>: add comma)</font> consider  <font color="red">(<b>edit 3</b>:)</font> <del> a quantity </del> <font color="red">the flux</font>
     <font color="red">(<b>edit 4</b>:)</font> <del> \( Q \). Without loss of generality,
    we assume </del> \( Q>0 \). There are three <font color="red"> (<b>edit 5</b>: delete comma)</font> fundamental <font color="red">(<b>edit 6</b>:)</font> <del> , basic </del>
     <font color="red">(<b>edit 7</b>:)</font> <del> property </del> <font color="red">properties</font> of \( Q \).  <font color="red">(<b>edit 8</b>:) These are not
    important for the following discussion.</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
To implement these edits, run

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<h2 id="___sec8">Verbatim/Computer Code </h2>

<p>
Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

<p>
Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code># sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

<p>
The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<p>
Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  cod-->
<pre><code>from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code> @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second line copies from the first line matching the <em>regular
expression</em> <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including, the line
matching the <em>regular expression</em> <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

<p>
The copied lines from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active for
<code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, html`, and <code>sphinx</code> outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (<code>envir=shpro</code>) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (<code>shpro</code>) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from <code>name=</code> until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to <code>!bc shcod</code>, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

<p>
Important warnings:

<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.</li>
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec9">LaTeX Mathematics </h2>

<p>
DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>,
pdflatex`, <code>pandoc</code>, and <code>mwiki</code> work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

<p>
Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
\( Ax=b \). To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

<p>
Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &amp;= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &amp;= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
This LaTeX code gets rendered as

$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$

Here is a single equation:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
which results in

$$ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.$$

<p>
Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

<ul>
 <li> AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>,
   and <code>ipynb</code> formats.</li>
 <li> Only five equation environments can be used: <code>\[ ... \]</code>,
   <code>equation*</code>, <code>equation</code>, <code>align*</code>, and <code>align</code>.</li>
 <li> Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   <code>newcommands*.tex</code>.</li>
 <li> MediaWiki (<code>mwiki</code>) does not support references to equations.</li>
</ul>

(DocOnce performs extensions to <code>sphinx</code> and other formats such that
labels in <code>align</code> environments work well.)

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success alert-text-normal"><b>Notice.</b>
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (<code>subfigure</code> package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code> and <code>html</code>, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using <code>doconce combine_images</code>),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see <em>Typesetting of Algorithms</em> in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

<p>
However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code>#if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;)</code>) to
include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
<code>.tex</code> produced by DocOnce.
</div>


<p>
<b>LaTeX Newcommands.</b>
The author can define <code>newcommand</code> statements in files with names
<code>newcommands*.tex</code>. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in <code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>ipynb</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire <code>newcommand</code> outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

<h2 id="___sec10">Hyperlinks </h2>

<p>
Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>Here is some &quot;some link text&quot;: &quot;http://some.net/address&quot;
(as in &quot;search google&quot;: &quot;http://google.com&quot;)
or just the raw address: URL: &quot;http://google.com&quot;.

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
&quot;`myfile.py`&quot;: &quot;http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py&quot;.

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
&quot;`hpl@simula.no`&quot;: &quot;mailto:hpl@simula.no&quot;
or just &quot;send mail&quot;: &quot;mailto:hpl@simula.no&quot;.

<h2 id="___sec11">Figures and Movies </h2>

<p>
Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Note three important syntax details:

<ol>
 <li> A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,</li>
 <li> no comments between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>frac</code> and no spaces
    around the <code>=</code> characters,</li>
 <li> all of the command must appear on a single line,</li>
 <li> there must be a blank line after the command.</li>
</ol>

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

<p>
The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> parameters affect HTML formats (<code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>),
while <code>frac</code> is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

<p>
Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

<p>
Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
This command applies <code>montage</code> or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

<p>
YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in <code>html</code> and <code>sphinx</code> documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The latter results in

<p>

<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Vimeo movie.</em>

<h2 id="___sec12">Tables </h2>

<p>
The table in the section <a href="#quick:sections">Section Types</a> was written with this
syntax:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that

<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).</li>
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).</li>
 <li> There must be a blank line before and after the table.</li>
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).</li>
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.</li>
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.</li>
</ul>

The command-line option <code>--tables2csv</code> (to <code>doconce format</code>)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file <code>table_X.csv</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

<p>
DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre><code>Terminal&gt; doconce csv2table mydata.csv &gt; mydata_table.do.txt
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Now we can do <code># #include &quot;mydata_table.do.txt&quot;</code> in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in <code>mydata_table.do.txt</code>
into the DocOnce file.

<h2 id="___sec13">Labels and References </h2>

<p>
The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>label{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like <code>:</code> or <code>_</code> between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

<p>
A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>ref{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

<p>
Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

<h2 id="___sec14">Citations and Bibliography </h2>

<p>
Single citations are written as
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>cite{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>cite{name1,name2,name3}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: papers.pub</code>,
where <code>papers.pub</code> is a publication database in the
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" target="_self">Publish</a> format.
BibTeX <code>.bib</code> files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

<h2 id="___sec15">Generalized References </h2>

<p>
There is a <em>generalized referencing</em> feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with <code>ref</code> to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  do-->
<pre><code>ref[internal][cite][external]
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
with a specific example being

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  do-->
<pre><code>As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a &quot;section&quot;:
&quot;testdoc.html#___sec2&quot; in the document
&quot;A Document for Testing DocOnce&quot;: &quot;testdoc.html&quot; cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
The output from a generalized reference is the text <code>internal</code> if all
references with <code>ref</code> in the text <code>internal</code> are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if <code>cite</code> is non-empty and the format is
<code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code>, one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line
<code># Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal</code> followed by <code>cite</code>,
and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
<code>external</code> text will be the output.

<h2 id="___sec16">Index of Keywords </h2>

<p>
DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>index{name}
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>,
<code>pdflatex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.

<h2 id="___sec17">Capabilities of The Program <code>doconce</code> </h2>

<p>
The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  shpro-->

<h2 id="___sec18">Exercises </h2>

<p>
DocOnce supports <em>Exercise</em>, <em>Problem</em>, <em>Project</em>, and <em>Example</em>.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain <em>elements</em>:

<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)</li>
  <li> a label (optional)</li>
  <li> a solution file (optional)</li>
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)</li>
  <li> main exercise text (required)</li>
  <li> a short answer (optional)</li>
  <li> a full solution (optional)</li>
  <li> one or more hints (optional)</li>
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)</li>
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
&quot;Wolframalpha&quot;: &quot;http://wolframalpha.com&quot; can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

<p>
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code>===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments <code>--without_answers</code> and <code>--without_solutions</code>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

<h2 id="___sec19">Environments </h2>

<p>
DocOnce environments start with <code>!benvirname</code> and end with <code>!eenvirname</code>,
where <code>envirname</code> is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

<ul>
 <li> <code>c</code>: computer code (or verbatim text)</li>
 <li> <code>t</code>: math blocks with LaTeX syntax</li>
 <li> <code>subex</code>: sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>ans</code>: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>sol</code>: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise</li>
 <li> <code>quote</code>: indented text</li>
 <li> <code>notice</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>hint</code>: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color</li>
 <li> <code>pop</code>: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations</li>
 <li> <code>slidecell</code>: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec20">Preprocessing </h2>

<p>
DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

<p>
The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, &quot;comment out&quot; a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre><code># #include &quot;myotherdoc.do.txt&quot;

# #if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;)
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} &amp; \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          &amp; 1.4186       &amp; -5.01        \\ 
2.0          &amp; 1.376512     &amp; 11.919       \\ 
4.0          &amp; 1.1E+1       &amp; 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->

<p>
With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" target="_self">example document</a> contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

\textbf{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}

\paragraph{Mission.}
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code \emph{once, in one place} and include it in traditional {\LaTeX}
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's \Verb!blogger.com!, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

\subsection{Supported Formats}

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\LaTeX} (format \Verb!latex! and \Verb!pdflatex!)

 \item HTML (format \Verb!html!)

 \item reStructuredText (format \Verb!rst!)

 \item plain (untagged) ASCII (format \Verb!plain!)

 \item Sphinx (format \Verb!sphinx!)

 \item IPython notebook (format \Verb!ipynb!)

 \item MediaWiki (format \Verb!mwiki!)

 \item (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format \Verb!pandoc!)

 \item Googlecode wiki (format \Verb!gwiki!)

 \item Creoloe wiki (format \Verb!cwiki!)

 \item Epydoc (format \Verb!epydoc!)

 \item StructuredText (format \Verb!st!)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are \Verb!latex!, \Verb!pdflatex!, \Verb!sphinx!, and \Verb!html!; and to a slightly
less extent \Verb!mwiki! and \Verb!pandoc!. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


\subsection{Emacs syntax support}

The file \href{{https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el}}{.doconce-mode.el}
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
\Verb!(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")! to the \Verb!.emacs! file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Emacs key } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Action } \\
\hline
Ctrl+c f      & figure                                           \\
Ctrl+c v      & movie/video                                      \\
Ctrl+c h1     & heading level 1 (section/h1)                     \\
Ctrl+c h2     & heading level 2 (subsection/h2)                  \\
Ctrl+c h3     & heading level 2 (subsection/h3)                  \\
Ctrl+c hp     & heading for paragraph                            \\

Ctrl+c table2 & table with 2 columns                             \\
Ctrl+c table3 & table with 3 columns                             \\
Ctrl+c table4 & table with 4 columns                             \\
Ctrl+c exer   & exercise outline                                 \\
Ctrl+c slide  & slide outline                                    \\
Ctrl+c help   & print this table                                 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
\subsection{Title, Authors, and Date}

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
\end{Verbatim}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
\end{Verbatim}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the \Verb!&! keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword \Verb!and! works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from \Verb!today! if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., \Verb!Jan 32, 2100!.

The table of contents is removed by writing \Verb!TOC: off!.


\subsection{Section Types}
\label{quick:sections}


\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Section type } & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Syntax } \\
\hline
chapter       & \Verb!========= Heading ========! (9 \Verb!=!)        \\
section       & \Verb!======= Heading =======!    (7 \Verb!=!)        \\
subsection    & \Verb!===== Heading =====!        (5 \Verb!=!)        \\
subsubsection & \Verb!=== Heading ===!            (3 \Verb!=!)        \\
paragraph     & \Verb!__Heading.__!               (2 \Verb!_!)        \\
abstract      & \Verb!__Abstract.__! Running text...                  \\
appendix      & \Verb!======= Appendix: heading =======! (7 \Verb!=!) \\
appendix      & \Verb!===== Appendix: heading =====! (5 \Verb!=!)     \\
exercise      & \Verb!======= Exercise: heading =======! (7 \Verb!=!) \\
exercise      & \Verb!===== Exercise: heading =====! (5 \Verb!=!)     \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with \Verb!__Abstract.__! or
\Verb!__Summary.__! at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more \Verb!=! signs of the next heading.

The \Verb!Exercise:! keyword kan be substituted by \Verb!Problem:! or \Verb!Project:!.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

\subsection{Inline Formatting}

Words surrounded by \Verb!*! are emphasized: \Verb!*emphasized words*! becomes
\emph{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: \Verb!_boldface_! becomes \textbf{boldface}. Colored words
are also possible: the text

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
`color{red}{two red words}`
\end{Verbatim}
becomes \textcolor{red}{two red words}.

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
\end{Verbatim}

A forced linebreak is specified by \Verb!<linebreak>! at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
\end{Verbatim}

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in {\LaTeX}:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
\end{Verbatim}

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
---------
\end{Verbatim}

The \Verb!latex!, \Verb!pdflatex!, \Verb!sphinx!, and \Verb!html! formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: \Verb!---!. Here is an example:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
\end{Verbatim}
This text is in the pdflatex rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
\emph{Premature optimization is the root of all evil.}--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns {\&} Roses or,Texas A {\&} M, is written as a
plain \Verb!&! \emph{with space(s) on both sides}. Single upper case letters on each
side of \Verb!&!, as in \Verb!Texas A {\&} M!, remove the spaces and result in,Texas A {\&} M, while words on both sides of \Verb!&!, as in \Verb!Guns {\&} Roses!,
preserve the spaces: Guns {\&} Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after \Verb!&! will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the \Verb!html!,
\Verb!latex!, and \Verb!pdflatex! formats.

Emojis, as defined in \href{{http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com}}{\nolinkurl{http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com}}, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) \Verb!:dizzy_face:! with blank or newline
before or after. Only the \Verb!pdflatex! and \Verb!html! output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
\Verb!--no_emoji! removes all emojis from the output document.

\subsection{Lists}

There are three types of lists: \emph{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with \Verb!*!, \emph{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with \Verb!o! and gets
consecutive numbers,
and \emph{description} lists, where each item starts with \Verb!-! followed
by a keyword and a colon.
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
\end{Verbatim}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

\begin{itemize}
 \item item1

 \item item2
\begin{itemize}

  \item subitem1 of item2

  \item subitem2 of item2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
 \item item3
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
\begin{enumerate}

 \item subitem1 of item2

 \item subitem2 of item2

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\item item3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
And finally a description list:

\begin{description}
 \item[keyword1:] 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 \item[keyword2:] 
   followed by text on the next line

 \item[keyword3:] 
   and its description may fit on one line
\end{description}

\noindent

\begin{warning_mdfboxadmon}[No indentation - except in lists!]
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.
\end{warning_mdfboxadmon}




\subsection{Comment lines}

Lines starting with \Verb!#! are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before {\LaTeX} math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats \Verb!rst! and
\Verb!sphinx! are desired.

Comment lines starting with \Verb!##! are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
\Verb!# #ifdef EXTRA! and \Verb!# #endif! around the text. The command line
option \Verb!-DEXTRA! will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


\subsection{Inline comments}

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
[name: running text]
\end{Verbatim}
where \Verb!name! is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and \Verb!running text! is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, \Verb!+! and \Verb!-!, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
\end{Verbatim}
which is rendered as


\begin{quote}
Some running text. \shortinlinecomment{hpl 1}{ There must be a space after the colon, but the running text can occupy multiple lines. }{ There must be a }
\end{quote}


The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with {\LaTeX} output and the \Verb!--latex_todonotes!
option to \Verb!doconce format!, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
\Verb!todonotes! package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
\end{Verbatim}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
\end{Verbatim}

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
[name: some text -> some replacement for text]
\end{Verbatim}

For example, the text

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
\end{Verbatim}
can be edited as

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
\end{Verbatim}
which in the pdflatex output format results in


\begin{quote}
First\textcolor{red}{, (\textbf{edit 2}: add comma)} consider \textcolor{red}{(edit 3:)} \replace{a quantity}{the flux}
(\textbf{edit 4}:) \remove{$Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume} $Q>0$. There are three \textcolor{red}{ (\textbf{edit 5}: delete comma)} fundamental(\textbf{edit 6}:) \remove{, basic}
\textcolor{red}{(edit 7:)} \replace{property}{properties} of $Q$.  \textcolor{red}{ (\textbf{edit 8}:) These are not
important for the following discussion.}
\end{quote}


To implement these edits, run

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Verbatim/Computer Code}

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
\end{Verbatim}
resulting in Some sentence with \Verb!words in verbatim style!.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between \Verb?!bc xxx? and \Verb?!ec? directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification \Verb!xxx! indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for \Verb!xxx! are
nothing, \Verb!cod! for a code snippet, \Verb!pro! for a complete program,
\Verb!sys! for a terminal session, \Verb!dat! for a data file (or output from a
program),
\Verb!Xpro! or \Verb!Xcod! for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming \Verb!X!, where \Verb!X! may be \Verb!py! for Python,
\Verb!cy! for Cython, \Verb!sh! for Bash or other Unix shells,
\Verb!f! for Fortran, \Verb!c! for C, \Verb!cpp! for C++, \Verb!m! for MATLAB,
\Verb!pl! for Perl. For output in \Verb!latex! one can let \Verb!xxx! reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the \Verb!ptex2tex! configuration file
(\Verb!.ptex2tex.cfg!). For \Verb!sphinx! output one can insert a comment
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
\end{Verbatim}
that maps environments (\Verb!xxx!) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what \Verb!sphinx! applies to typeset computer code).

The \Verb!xxx! specifier has only effect for \Verb!latex! and
\Verb!sphinx! output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
\end{Verbatim}

% When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise
% ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
\end{Verbatim}
The \Verb!@@@CODE! identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file \Verb!doconce_program.sh!.
The second line copies from the first line matching the \emph{regular
expression} \Verb!doconce clean! up to, but not including, the line
matching the \emph{regular expression} \Verb!^doconce split_rst!.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside \Verb?!bc shpro?
and \Verb?!ec? directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become \Verb?!bc shcod? and \Verb?!ec? when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension \Verb!.X!, the environment
becomes \Verb?!bc Xpro? or \Verb?!bc Xcod? for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (\Verb!Xcod! and \Verb!Xpro!) are only active for
\Verb!latex!, \Verb!pdflatex!, html`, and \Verb!sphinx! outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (\Verb!envir=shpro!) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (\Verb!shpro!) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from \Verb!name=! until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to \Verb?!bc shcod?, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 \item Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard {\LaTeX} syntax. The output formats \Verb!html!, \Verb!sphinx!, \Verb!latex!,
pdflatex`, \Verb!pandoc!, and \Verb!mwiki! work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw {\LaTeX} code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
{\LaTeX} way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than \Verb!sphinx!,
\Verb!latex!, and \Verb!pdflatex!, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
\end{Verbatim}
That is, the {\LaTeX} expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of {\LaTeX} mathematics are written within
\Verb?!bt?
and
\Verb?!et? (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
\end{Verbatim}

This {\LaTeX} code gets rendered as

\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
Here is a single equation:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
\end{Verbatim}
which results in

\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]

Any {\LaTeX} syntax is accepted, but if output in the \Verb!sphinx!, \Verb!pandoc!,
\Verb!mwiki!, \Verb!html!, or \Verb!ipynb! formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

\begin{itemize}
 \item AMS {\LaTeX} mathematics is supported, also for the \Verb!html!, \Verb!sphinx!,
   and \Verb!ipynb! formats.

 \item Only five equation environments can be used: \Verb!\[ ... \]!,
   \Verb!equation*!, \Verb!equation!, \Verb!align*!, and \Verb!align!.

 \item Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   \Verb!newcommands*.tex!.

 \item MediaWiki (\Verb!mwiki!) does not support references to equations.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
(DocOnce performs extensions to \Verb!sphinx! and other formats such that
labels in \Verb!align! environments work well.)


\begin{notice_mdfboxadmon}[Notice.]
{\LaTeX} supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (\Verb!subfigure! package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as \Verb!sphinx! and \Verb!html!, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard {\LaTeX}. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using \Verb!doconce combine_images!),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see \emph{Typesetting of Algorithms} in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically \Verb!#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")!) to
include special code for \Verb!latex! and \Verb!pdflatex! output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced {\LaTeX} features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
\Verb!.tex! produced by DocOnce.
\end{notice_mdfboxadmon}



\paragraph{LaTeX Newcommands.}
The author can define \Verb!newcommand! statements in files with names
\Verb!newcommands*.tex!. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other {\LaTeX} constructions are only understood by {\LaTeX} itself).
The convention is that \Verb!newcommands_keep.tex!
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in \Verb!newcommands_replace.tex! will be replaced by their full
{\LaTeX} code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without {\LaTeX} support. For \Verb!html!, \Verb!sphinx!, \Verb!latex!, \Verb!pdflatex!,
\Verb!mwiki!, \Verb!ipynb!, and \Verb!pandoc!, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire \Verb!newcommand! outside {\LaTeX}
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).


\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Figures and Movies}

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

\end{Verbatim}
Note three important syntax details:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 \item no comments between \Verb!width!, \Verb!height!, and \Verb!frac! and no spaces
    around the \Verb!=! characters,

 \item all of the command must appear on a single line,

 \item there must be a blank line after the command.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or {\LaTeX} formats). The \Verb!width!
and \Verb!height! parameters affect HTML formats (\Verb!html!, \Verb!rst!, \Verb!sphinx!),
while \Verb!frac! is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the \Verb!latex! and \Verb!pdflatex! formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
\end{Verbatim}
This command applies \Verb!montage! or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in \Verb!html! and \Verb!sphinx! documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

\end{Verbatim}
The latter results in


\begin{doconce:movie}
\refstepcounter{doconce:movie:counter}
\begin{center}\href{{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}{\nolinkurl{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}\end{center}

\begin{center}  % movie caption
Movie \arabic{doconce:movie:counter}: Vimeo movie.
\end{center}
\end{doconce:movie}



\subsection{Tables}

The table in Section~\ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

\end{Verbatim}

Note that

\begin{itemize}
 \item Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item There must be a blank line before and after the table.

 \item There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 \item If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in {\LaTeX}.

 \item Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The command-line option \Verb!--tables2csv! (to \Verb!doconce format!)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file \Verb!table_X.csv!,
where \Verb!X! is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt
\end{Verbatim}
Now we can do \Verb!# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"! in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in \Verb!mydata_table.do.txt!
into the DocOnce file.

\subsection{Labels and References}

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from {\LaTeX} with a very similar syntax. As in {\LaTeX}, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
label{name}
\end{Verbatim}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose \Verb!name!
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like \Verb!:! or \Verb!_! between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label \Verb!name! is written as
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
ref{name}
\end{Verbatim}
again with no backslash before \Verb!ref!.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


\subsection{Citations and Bibliography}

Single citations are written as
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
cite{name}
\end{Verbatim}
where \Verb!name! is a logical name
of the reference (again, {\LaTeX} writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have \Verb!name! on the form
\Verb!Author1_Author2_YYYY!, \Verb!Author_YYYY!, or \Verb!Author1_etal_YYYY!, where
\Verb!YYYY! is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
cite{name1,name2,name3}
\end{Verbatim}

The bibliography is specified by a line \Verb!BIBFILE: papers.pub!,
where \Verb!papers.pub! is a publication database in the
\href{{https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish}}{Publish} format.
\textsc{Bib}\negthinspace{\TeX} \Verb!.bib! files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than {\LaTeX}).

\subsection{Generalized References}

There is a \emph{generalized referencing} feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with \Verb!ref! to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
ref[internal][cite][external]
\end{Verbatim}
with a specific example being

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
\end{Verbatim}
The output from a generalized reference is the text \Verb!internal! if all
references with \Verb!ref! in the text \Verb!internal! are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if \Verb!cite! is non-empty and the format is
\Verb!latex! or \Verb!pdflatex!, one assumes that the references in \Verb!internal!
are to external documents declared by a comment line
\Verb!# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc! (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is \Verb!internal! followed by \Verb!cite!,
and the
{\LaTeX} package \Verb!xr! is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
\Verb!external! text will be the output.

\subsection{Index of Keywords}

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
index{name}
\end{Verbatim}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the \Verb!latex!,
\Verb!pdflatex!, \Verb!rst!, and \Verb!sphinx! formats.

\subsection{Capabilities of The Program \protect\Verb!doconce! }

The \Verb!doconce! program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a \Verb!.do.txt! file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]

\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Exercises}

DocOnce supports \emph{Exercise}, \emph{Problem}, \emph{Project}, and \emph{Example}.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain \emph{elements}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  \item a label (optional)

  \item a solution file (optional)

  \item name of file with a student solution (optional)

  \item main exercise text (required)

  \item a short answer (optional)

  \item a full solution (optional)

  \item one or more hints (optional)

  \item one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
\end{Verbatim}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\end{Verbatim}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments \Verb!--without_answers! and \Verb!--without_solutions!
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


\subsection{Environments}

DocOnce environments start with \Verb?!benvirname? and end with \Verb?!eenvirname?,
where \Verb!envirname! is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \Verb!c!: computer code (or verbatim text)

 \item \Verb!t!: math blocks with {\LaTeX} syntax

 \item \Verb!subex!: sub-exercise

 \item \Verb!ans!: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 \item \Verb!sol!: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 \item \Verb!quote!: indented text

 \item \Verb!notice!, \Verb!summary!, \Verb!warning!, \Verb!question!, \Verb!hint!: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 \item \Verb!pop!: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 \item \Verb!slidecell!: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\subsection{Preprocessing}

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either \Verb!preprocess! and/or
\Verb!mako!. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The \Verb!mako! preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command \Verb!doconce format! first runs \Verb!preprocess! and then \Verb!mako!.
Here is a typical example on utilizing \Verb!preprocess! to include another
document, ``comment out'' a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},baselinestretch=0.95,xleftmargin=2mm]
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
\end{Verbatim}

With the \Verb!mako! preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/}}{example document} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize \Verb!mako! (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the \Verb!doc/src/make.sh! script).

DocOnce Quick Reference
=======================

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :depth: 2

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

**Mission.**
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's ``blogger.com``, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * IPython notebook (format ``ipynb``)

 * MediaWiki (format ``mwiki``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * Googlecode wiki (format ``gwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html``; and to a slightly
less extent ``mwiki`` and ``pandoc``. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file `.doconce-mode.el <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>`__
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
``(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")`` to the ``.emacs`` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

=============  ==========================================  
  Emacs key                      Action                    
=============  ==========================================

=============  ==========================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::

        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::

        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the ``&`` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword ``and`` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Jan 32, 2100``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.

Section Types
-------------

=============  ===============================================  
 Section type                       Syntax                      
=============  ===============================================  
chapter        ``========= Heading ========`` (9 ``=``)         
section        ``======= Heading =======``    (7 ``=``)         
subsection     ``===== Heading =====``        (5 ``=``)         
subsubsection  ``=== Heading ===``            (3 ``=``)         
paragraph      ``__Heading.__``               (2 ``_``)         
abstract       ``__Abstract.__`` Running text...                
appendix       ``======= Appendix: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
appendix       ``===== Appendix: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
exercise       ``======= Exercise: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
exercise       ``===== Exercise: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
=============  ===============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` or
``__Summary.__`` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more ``=`` signs of the next heading.

The ``Exercise:`` keyword kan be substituted by ``Problem:`` or ``Project:``.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text::

        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes **two red words**.
(But colors do not work in format rst).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes::

        This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.

A forced linebreak is specified by ``<linebreak>`` at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears::

        Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
        to a new and simpler equation.
        
        [^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
        $\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.
        
        Here comes a new paragraph...

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX::

        This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

---------

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line::

        ---------

The ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html`` formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: ``---``. Here is an example::

        The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
        space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
        *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

This text is in the rst rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain ``&`` *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of ``&``, as in ``Texas A & M``, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of ``&``, as in ``Guns & Roses``,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after ``&`` will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the ``html``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Emojis, as defined in `<http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com>`_, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) ``:dizzy_face:`` with blank or newline
before or after. Only the ``pdflatex`` and ``html`` output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
``--no_emoji`` removes all emojis from the output document.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon::

        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2,
            second line of subitem2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
        shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
        right below the line above.
        
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2

 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line


.. admonition:: No indentation - except in lists

   DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
   No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
   Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.




Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

Comment lines starting with ``##`` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
``# #ifdef EXTRA`` and ``# #endif`` around the text. The command line
option ``-DEXTRA`` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.

Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::

        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, ``+`` and ``-``, as well
as space. Here goes an example::

        Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]

which is rendered as


..

    Some running text. **(**hpl 1**: There must be a space after the colon,
    but the running text can occupy multiple lines.**)



The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the ``--latex_todonotes``
option to ``doconce format``, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
``todonotes`` package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by::

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing::

        [add: ,]
        [add: .]
        [add: ;]
        [del: ,]
        [del: ,]
        [del: .]
        [del: ;]
        [add: some text]
        [del: some text]
        [edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
        [name: some text -> some replacement for text]

For example, the text::

        First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
        $Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.

can be edited as::

        First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
        [edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]

which in the rst output format results in


..

    Firstcolor{red}{(**add 2**: ,}) consider **(**edit 3**: a quantity -> the flux**)
    **(**del 4**: Q. Without loss of generality,
    we assume**) Q>0. There are threecolor{red}{(**del 5**: ,}) fundamentalcolor{red}{(**del 6**: , basic})
    **(**edit 7**: property -> properties**) of Q. **(**add 8**: These are not
    important for the following discussion.**)



To implement these edits, run::

        Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::

        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment::

        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)

.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file::

         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active for
``latex``, ``pdflatex``, html`, and ``sphinx`` outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (``envir=shpro``) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (``shpro``) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from ``name=`` until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to ``!bc shcod``, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``,
pdflatex`, ``pandoc``, and ``mwiki`` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::

        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::

        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et

This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::

        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
``mwiki``, ``html``, or ``ipynb`` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the ``html``, ``sphinx``,
   and ``ipynb`` formats.

 * Only five equation environments can be used: ``\[ ... \]``,
   ``equation*``, ``equation``, ``align*``, and ``align``.

 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   ``newcommands*.tex``.

 * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. note::
   LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
   plots in the same figure (``subfigure`` package), margin notes, multi-page
   tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
   Other output formats, such as ``sphinx`` and ``html``, make it necessary for DocOnce
   to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
   must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
   one plot per figure (combine them into one using ``doconce combine_images``),
   example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
   algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce
   manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
   instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
   some.
   
   However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
   the format (typically ``#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
   include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
   straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
   also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
   PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
   ``.tex`` produced by DocOnce.




**LaTeX Newcommands.**
The author can define ``newcommand`` statements in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that ``newcommands_keep.tex``
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in ``newcommands_replace.tex`` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``,
``mwiki``, ``ipynb``, and ``pandoc``, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire ``newcommand`` outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::

        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::

        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between ``width``, ``height``, and ``frac`` and no spaces
    around the ``=`` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The ``width``
and ``height`` parameters affect HTML formats (``html``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``),
while ``frac`` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies ``montage`` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in ``html`` and ``sphinx`` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::

        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Vimeo movie.</em>
        

Tables
------

The table in the section `Section Types`_ was written with this
syntax::

        
        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option ``--tables2csv`` (to ``doconce format``)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file ``table_X.csv``,
where ``X`` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files::

        Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt

Now we can do ``# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"`` in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in ``mydata_table.do.txt``
into the DocOnce file.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::

        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like ``:`` or ``_`` between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as::

        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::

        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::

        cite{name1,name2,name3}

The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: papers.pub``,
where ``papers.pub`` is a publication database in the
`Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`__ format.
BibTeX ``.bib`` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized References
----------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with ``ref`` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::

        ref[internal][cite][external]

with a specific example being::

        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        DocOnce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text ``internal`` if all
references with ``ref`` in the text ``internal`` are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if ``cite`` is non-empty and the format is
``latex`` or ``pdflatex``, one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line
``# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal`` followed by ``cite``,
and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
``external`` text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::

        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``,
``pdflatex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of The Program ``doconce``
---------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::

        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::

        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::

        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments ``--without_answers`` and ``--without_solutions``
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

Environments
------------

DocOnce environments start with ``!benvirname`` and end with ``!eenvirname``,
where ``envirname`` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * ``c``: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * ``t``: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * ``subex``: sub-exercise

 * ``ans``: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``sol``: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``quote``: indented text

 * ``notice``, ``summary``, ``warning``, ``question``, ``hint``: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * ``pop``: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * ``slidecell``: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::

        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}

With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`__ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

DocOnce Quick Reference
=======================

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Jan 32, 2100

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

**Mission.**
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's ``blogger.com``, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

.. !split

Supported Formats
-----------------

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * IPython notebook (format ``ipynb``)

 * MediaWiki (format ``mwiki``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * Googlecode wiki (format ``gwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html``; and to a slightly
less extent ``mwiki`` and ``pandoc``. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

.. !split

Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file `.doconce-mode.el <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>`__
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
``(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")`` to the ``.emacs`` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

=============  ==========================================  
  Emacs key                      Action

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

.. code-block:: text

        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

.. code-block:: text

        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the ``&`` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword ``and`` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Jan 32, 2100``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.

Section Types
-------------

=============  ===============================================  
 Section type                       Syntax                      
=============  ===============================================  
chapter        ``========= Heading ========`` (9 ``=``)         
section        ``======= Heading =======``    (7 ``=``)         
subsection     ``===== Heading =====``        (5 ``=``)         
subsubsection  ``=== Heading ===``            (3 ``=``)         
paragraph      ``__Heading.__``               (2 ``_``)         
abstract       ``__Abstract.__`` Running text...                
appendix       ``======= Appendix: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
appendix       ``===== Appendix: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
exercise       ``======= Exercise: heading =======`` (7 ``=``)  
exercise       ``===== Exercise: heading =====`` (5 ``=``)      
=============  ===============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` or
``__Summary.__`` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more ``=`` signs of the next heading.

The ``Exercise:`` keyword kan be substituted by ``Problem:`` or ``Project:``.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

.. !split

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text

.. code-block:: text

        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes **two red words**.
(But colors do not work in format sphinx).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

.. code-block:: text

        This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.

A forced linebreak is specified by ``<linebreak>`` at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

.. code-block:: text

        Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
        to a new and simpler equation.
        
        [^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
        $\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.
        
        Here comes a new paragraph...

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

.. code-block:: text

        This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

---------

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

.. code-block:: text

        ---------

The ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``sphinx``, and ``html`` formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: ``---``. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: text

        The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
        space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
        *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

This text is in the sphinx rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain ``&`` *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of ``&``, as in ``Texas A & M``, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of ``&``, as in ``Guns & Roses``,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after ``&`` will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the ``html``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Emojis, as defined in `<http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com>`_, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) ``:dizzy_face:`` with blank or newline
before or after. Only the ``pdflatex`` and ``html`` output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
``--no_emoji`` removes all emojis from the output document.

.. !split

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

.. code-block:: text

        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2,
            second line of subitem2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
        shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
        right below the line above.
        
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2

 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line


.. admonition:: No indentation - except in lists

   DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
   No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
   Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.




.. !split

Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

Comment lines starting with ``##`` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
``# #ifdef EXTRA`` and ``# #endif`` around the text. The command line
option ``-DEXTRA`` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.

.. !split

Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax

.. code-block:: text

        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, ``+`` and ``-``, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

.. code-block:: text

        Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]

which is rendered as


..

    Some running text. [**hpl 1**: There must be a space after the colon, but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]



The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the ``--latex_todonotes``
option to ``doconce format``, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
``todonotes`` package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running

.. code-block:: text

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by

.. code-block:: text

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

.. code-block:: text

        [add: ,]
        [add: .]
        [add: ;]
        [del: ,]
        [del: ,]
        [del: .]
        [del: ;]
        [add: some text]
        [del: some text]
        [edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
        [name: some text -> some replacement for text]

For example, the text

.. code-block:: text

        First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
        $Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.

can be edited as

.. code-block:: text

        First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
        [edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]

which in the sphinx output format results in


..

    First, (**edit 2: add comma**) consider (**edit 3: remove** a quantity) (**insert:**)the flux (**end insert**)
    (**edit 4**: **delete** :math:`Q`. Without loss of generality,
    we assume) :math:`Q>0`. There are three (**edit 5**: delete comma) fundamental(**edit 6**: **delete** , basic)
    (**edit 7: remove** property) (**insert:**)properties (**end insert**) of :math:`Q`.  (**edit 8: add**) These are not
    important for the following discussion. (**end add**)



To implement these edits, run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt

.. !split

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

.. code-block:: text

        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment

.. code-block:: text

        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)

.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file:

.. code-block:: text

         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active for
``latex``, ``pdflatex``, html`, and ``sphinx`` outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (``envir=shpro``) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (``shpro``) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from ``name=`` until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to ``!bc shcod``, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

.. !split

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``,
pdflatex`, ``pandoc``, and ``mwiki`` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
:math:`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

.. code-block:: text

        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

.. math::
        
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        

Here is a single equation:

.. code-block:: text

        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in

.. math::
         \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
``mwiki``, ``html``, or ``ipynb`` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the ``html``, ``sphinx``,
   and ``ipynb`` formats.

 * Only five equation environments can be used: ``\[ ... \]``,
   ``equation*``, ``equation``, ``align*``, and ``align``.

 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   ``newcommands*.tex``.

 * MediaWiki (``mwiki``) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to ``sphinx`` and other formats such that
labels in ``align`` environments work well.)


.. note::
   LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
   plots in the same figure (``subfigure`` package), margin notes, multi-page
   tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
   Other output formats, such as ``sphinx`` and ``html``, make it necessary for DocOnce
   to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
   must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
   one plot per figure (combine them into one using ``doconce combine_images``),
   example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
   algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce
   manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
   instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
   some.
   
   However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
   the format (typically ``#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
   include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
   straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
   also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
   PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
   ``.tex`` produced by DocOnce.




**LaTeX Newcommands.**
The author can define ``newcommand`` statements in files with names
``newcommands*.tex``. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that ``newcommands_keep.tex``
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in ``newcommands_replace.tex`` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For ``html``, ``sphinx``, ``latex``, ``pdflatex``,
``mwiki``, ``ipynb``, and ``pandoc``, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire ``newcommand`` outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

.. code-block:: text

        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

.. !split

Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

.. code-block:: text

        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between ``width``, ``height``, and ``frac`` and no spaces
    around the ``=`` characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The ``width``
and ``height`` parameters affect HTML formats (``html``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``),
while ``frac`` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the

.. code-block:: text

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies ``montage`` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in ``html`` and ``sphinx`` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

.. code-block:: text

        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

.. raw:: html
        
        <iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <em>Vimeo movie.</em>
        

.. !split

Tables
------

The table in the section :ref:`quick:sections` was written with this
syntax:

.. code-block:: text

        
        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option ``--tables2csv`` (to ``doconce format``)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file ``table_X.csv``,
where ``X`` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt

Now we can do ``# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"`` in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in ``mydata_table.do.txt``
into the DocOnce file.

.. !split

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

.. code-block:: text

        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like ``:`` or ``_`` between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as

.. code-block:: text

        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

.. !split

Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as

.. code-block:: text

        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

.. code-block:: text

        cite{name1,name2,name3}

The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: papers.pub``,
where ``papers.pub`` is a publication database in the
`Publish <https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>`__ format.
BibTeX ``.bib`` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

.. !split

Generalized References
----------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with ``ref`` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

.. code-block:: doconce

        ref[internal][cite][external]

with a specific example being

.. code-block:: doconce

        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        DocOnce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text ``internal`` if all
references with ``ref`` in the text ``internal`` are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if ``cite`` is non-empty and the format is
``latex`` or ``pdflatex``, one assumes that the references in ``internal``
are to external documents declared by a comment line
``# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc`` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is ``internal`` followed by ``cite``,
and the
LaTeX package ``xr`` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
``external`` text will be the output.

.. !split

Index of Keywords
-----------------

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

.. code-block:: text

        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``,
``pdflatex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.

.. !split

Capabilities of The Program ``doconce``
---------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

Exercises
---------

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

.. code-block:: text

        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

.. code-block:: text

        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

.. code-block:: text

        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments ``--without_answers`` and ``--without_solutions``
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

.. !split

Environments
------------

DocOnce environments start with ``!benvirname`` and end with ``!eenvirname``,
where ``envirname`` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * ``c``: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * ``t``: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * ``subex``: sub-exercise

 * ``ans``: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``sol``: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * ``quote``: indented text

 * ``notice``, ``summary``, ``warning``, ``question``, ``hint``: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * ``pop``: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * ``slidecell``: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

.. !split

Preprocessing
-------------

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

.. code-block:: text

        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"

#summary DocOnce Quick Reference

By *Hans Petter Langtangen*
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

<wiki: toc max_depth="2" />



*WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!*

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

==== Supported Formats ====

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


==== Emacs syntax support ====

The file [https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el .doconce-mode.el]
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


 ||    _Emacs key_     ||                  _Action_                   ||
 ||  Ctrl+c f          ||  figure                                     ||
 ||  Ctrl+c v          ||  movie/video                                ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h1         ||  heading level 1 (section/h1)               ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h2         ||  heading level 2 (subsection/h2)            ||
 ||  Ctrl+c h3         ||  heading level 2 (subsection/h3)            ||

 ||  Ctrl+c table4     ||  table with 4 columns                       ||
 ||  Ctrl+c exer       ||  exercise outline                           ||
 ||  Ctrl+c slide      ||  slide outline                              ||
 ||  Ctrl+c help       ||  print this table                           ||


==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


==== Section Types ====


 ||   _Section type_   ||                     _Syntax_                     ||
 ||  chapter           ||  `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)            ||
 ||  section           ||  `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)            ||
 ||  subsection        ||  `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)            ||
 ||  subsubsection     ||  `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)            ||
 ||  paragraph         ||  `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)            ||
 ||  abstract          ||  `__Abstract.__` Running text...                 ||
 ||  appendix          ||  `======= Appendix: heading =======` (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  appendix          ||  `===== Appendix: heading =====` (5 `=`)         ||
 ||  exercise          ||  `======= Exercise: heading =======` (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  exercise          ||  `===== Exercise: heading =====` (5 `=`)         ||


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes *boldface*. Colored words
are also possible: the text

{{{
`color{red}{two red words}`
}}}
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.
(But colors do not work in format gwiki).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

{{{
This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
}}}

A forced linebreak is specified by `<linebreak>` at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

{{{
Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
}}}

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

{{{
This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
}}}

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

{{{
---------
}}}

The `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html` formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: `---`. Here is an example:

{{{
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
}}}
This text is in the gwiki rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain `&` *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of `&`, as in `Texas A & M`, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of `&`, as in `Guns & Roses`,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after `&` will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the `html`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex` formats.

Emojis, as defined in http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) `:dizzy_face:` with blank or newline
before or after. Only the `pdflatex` and `html` output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
`--no_emoji` removes all emojis from the output document.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 # subitem1 of item2
 # subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

*No indentation - except in lists!* 
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.




==== Comment lines ====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


==== Inline comments ====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, `+` and `-`, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

{{{
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
}}}
which is rendered as





The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the `--latex_todonotes`
option to `doconce format`, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
`todonotes` package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

{{{
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
[name: some text -> some replacement for text]
}}}

For example, the text

{{{
First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
}}}
can be edited as

{{{
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
}}}
which in the gwiki output format results in





To implement these edits, run

{{{
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

{{{
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
}}}
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active for
`latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (`envir=shpro`) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (`shpro`) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to `!bc shcod`, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

{{{
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
}}}

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
Here is a single equation:

{{{
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
}}}
which results in

{{{
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
}}}

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the `html`, `sphinx`,   and `ipynb` formats.
 * Only five equation environments can be used: `\[ ... \]`,   `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, and `align`.
 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names   `newcommands*.tex`.
 * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (`subfigure` package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as `sphinx` and `html`, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using `doconce combine_images`),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
`.tex` produced by DocOnce.



*LaTeX Newcommands.*
The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire `newcommand` outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).


==== Hyperlinks ====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

{{{
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
}}}

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note three important syntax details:


 # A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 # no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces    around the `=` characters,
 # all of the command must appear on a single line,
 # there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
}}}
This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

{{{
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

}}}
The latter results in

Vimeo movie. `http://vimeo.com/55562330`: load [movie_player1.html `movie_player1.html`] into a browser


==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

{{{
Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt
}}}
Now we can do `# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"` in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in `mydata_table.do.txt`
into the DocOnce file.

==== Labels and References ====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like `:` or `_` between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


==== Citations and Bibliography ====

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish Publish] format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

==== Generalized References ====

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

{{{
ref[internal][cite][external]
}}}
with a specific example being

{{{
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
}}}
The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
references with `ref` in the text `internal` are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if `cite` is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex`, one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line
`# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal` followed by `cite`,
and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

==== Index of Keywords ====

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

==== Capabilities of The Program `doconce` ====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

==== Exercises ====

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

{{{
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
}}}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


==== Environments ====

DocOnce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a   slide

==== Preprocessing ====

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

************** File: quickref.mwiki *****************
#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): DocOnce Quick Reference

By '''Hans Petter Langtangen'''
==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

__TOC__



'''WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!'''

''Mission.''
Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code ''once, in one place'' and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's <code>blogger.com</code>, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

==== Supported Formats ====

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:


<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>)
 <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>)
 <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>)
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>)
 <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>)
 <li> IPython notebook (format <code>ipynb</code>)
 <li> MediaWiki (format <code>mwiki</code>)
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>)
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>)
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>)
 <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>)
 <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)
</ul>

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code>; and to a slightly
less extent <code>mwiki</code> and <code>pandoc</code>. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


==== Emacs syntax support ====

The file [https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el .doconce-mode.el]
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
<code>(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")</code> to the <code>.emacs</code> file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">  Emacs key  </th> <th align="center">                           Action                           </th> </tr>

</tbody>
</table>
==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</syntaxhighlight>
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
</syntaxhighlight>
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the <code>&</code> keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword <code>and</code> works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Jan 32, 2100</code>.

The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.


==== Section Types ====

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center"> Section type</th> <th align="center">                              Syntax                             </th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter          </td> <td align="left">   <code>========= Heading ========</code> (9 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section          </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Heading =======</code>    (7 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection       </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Heading =====</code>        (5 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection    </td> <td align="left">   <code>=== Heading ===</code>            (3 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph        </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Heading.__</code>               (2 <code>_</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract         </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Abstract.__</code> Running text...                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix         </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Appendix: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix         </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Appendix: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise         </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Exercise: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise         </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Exercise: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> or
<code>__Summary.__</code> at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more <code>=</code> signs of the next heading.

The <code>Exercise:</code> keyword kan be substituted by <code>Problem:</code> or <code>Project:</code>.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
''emphasized words''. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> becomes '''boldface'''. Colored words
are also possible: the text

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
`color{red}{two red words}`
</syntaxhighlight>
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.
(But colors do not work in format mwiki).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
</syntaxhighlight>

A forced linebreak is specified by <code><linebreak></code> at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
</syntaxhighlight>

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
</syntaxhighlight>

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
---------
</syntaxhighlight>

The <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, and <code>html</code> formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: <code>---</code>. Here is an example:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
</syntaxhighlight>
This text is in the mwiki rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
''Premature optimization is the root of all evil.''--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain <code>&</code> ''with space(s) on both sides''. Single upper case letters on each
side of <code>&</code>, as in <code>Texas A & M</code>, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of <code>&</code>, as in <code>Guns & Roses</code>,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after <code>&</code> will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the <code>html</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

Emojis, as defined in http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) <code>:dizzy_face:</code> with blank or newline
before or after. Only the <code>pdflatex</code> and <code>html</code> output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
<code>--no_emoji</code> removes all emojis from the output document.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: ''bullet lists'', where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, ''enumeration lists'', where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consecutive numbers,
and ''description'' lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</syntaxhighlight>
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


<ul>
 <li> item1
 <li> item2

<ul>
  <li><li> subitem1 of item2
  <li><li> subitem2 of item2
</ul>

 <li> item3
</ul>

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:


<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

<ol>
 <li><li> subitem1 of item2
 <li><li> subitem2 of item2
</ol>

<li> item3
</ol>

And finally a description list:


<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>


{{mbox
| type = warning
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''No indentation - except in lists!''' DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.
}}




==== Comment lines ====

Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

Comment lines starting with <code>##</code> are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
<code># #ifdef EXTRA</code> and <code># #endif</code> around the text. The command line
option <code>-DEXTRA</code> will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


==== Inline comments ====

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
[name: running text]
</syntaxhighlight>
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
</syntaxhighlight>
which is rendered as


{{quote box
| quote = Some running text. [hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
}}



The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the <code>--latex_todonotes</code>
option to <code>doconce format</code>, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
<code>todonotes</code> package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</syntaxhighlight>
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</syntaxhighlight>

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
[name: some text -> some replacement for text]
</syntaxhighlight>

For example, the text

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
</syntaxhighlight>
can be edited as

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
</syntaxhighlight>
which in the mwiki output format results in


{{quote box
| quote = First[add 2: ,] consider [edit 3: a quantity -> the flux]
[del 4: <math>Q</math>. Without loss of generality,
we assume] <math>Q>0</math>. There are three[del 5: ,] fundamental[del 6: , basic]
[edit 7: property -> properties] of <math>Q</math>. [add 8: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
}}



To implement these edits, run

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</syntaxhighlight>
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</syntaxhighlight>
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
</syntaxhighlight>

<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
</syntaxhighlight>
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second line copies from the first line matching the ''regular
expression'' <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including, the line
matching the ''regular expression'' <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active for
<code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, html`, and <code>sphinx</code> outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (<code>envir=shpro</code>) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (<code>shpro</code>) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from <code>name=</code> until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to <code>!bc shcod</code>, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:


<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
</ul>

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>,
pdflatex`, <code>pandoc</code>, and <code>mwiki</code> work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
<math>Ax=b</math>. To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</syntaxhighlight>
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
</syntaxhighlight>

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

:<math>
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
</math>
Here is a single equation:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
</syntaxhighlight>
which results in

:<math>
 \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.
</math>

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>html</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


<ul>
 <li> AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>,
   and <code>ipynb</code> formats.
 <li> Only five equation environments can be used: <code>\[ ... \]</code>,
   <code>equation*</code>, <code>equation</code>, <code>align*</code>, and <code>align</code>.
 <li> Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   <code>newcommands*.tex</code>.
 <li> MediaWiki (<code>mwiki</code>) does not support references to equations.
</ul>

(DocOnce performs extensions to <code>sphinx</code> and other formats such that
labels in <code>align</code> environments work well.)


{{mbox
| type = notice
| textstyle = font-size: 90%;
| text = '''Notice.''' LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (<code>subfigure</code> package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code> and <code>html</code>, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using <code>doconce combine_images</code>),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see ''Typesetting of Algorithms'' in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code>#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</code>) to
include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
<code>.tex</code> produced by DocOnce.
}}



''LaTeX Newcommands.''
The author can define <code>newcommand</code> statements in files with names
<code>newcommands*.tex</code>. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in <code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For <code>html</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>,
<code>mwiki</code>, <code>ipynb</code>, and <code>pandoc</code>, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire <code>newcommand</code> outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).


==== Hyperlinks ====

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
</syntaxhighlight>

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</syntaxhighlight>
Note three important syntax details:


<ol>
 <li> A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 <li> no comments between <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>frac</code> and no spaces
    around the <code>=</code> characters,
 <li> all of the command must appear on a single line,
 <li> there must be a blank line after the command.
</ol>

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> parameters affect HTML formats (<code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>),
while <code>frac</code> is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
</syntaxhighlight>
This command applies <code>montage</code> or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in <code>html</code> and <code>sphinx</code> documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

</syntaxhighlight>
The latter results in

Vimeo movie. <code>http://vimeo.com/55562330</code>: load [movie_player1.html <code>movie_player1.html</code>] into a browser


==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

</syntaxhighlight>

Note that


<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
</ul>

The command-line option <code>--tables2csv</code> (to <code>doconce format</code>)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file <code>table_X.csv</code>,
where <code>X</code> is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt
</syntaxhighlight>
Now we can do <code># #include "mydata_table.do.txt"</code> in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in <code>mydata_table.do.txt</code>
into the DocOnce file.

==== Labels and References ====

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
label{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like <code>:</code> or <code>_</code> between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
ref{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


==== Citations and Bibliography ====

Single citations are written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
cite{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
cite{name1,name2,name3}
</syntaxhighlight>

The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: papers.pub</code>,
where <code>papers.pub</code> is a publication database in the
[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish Publish] format.
BibTeX <code>.bib</code> files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

==== Generalized References ====

There is a ''generalized referencing'' feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with <code>ref</code> to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
ref[internal][cite][external]
</syntaxhighlight>
with a specific example being

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
</syntaxhighlight>
The output from a generalized reference is the text <code>internal</code> if all
references with <code>ref</code> in the text <code>internal</code> are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if <code>cite</code> is non-empty and the format is
<code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code>, one assumes that the references in <code>internal</code>
are to external documents declared by a comment line
<code># Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</code> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <code>internal</code> followed by <code>cite</code>,
and the
LaTeX package <code>xr</code> is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
<code>external</code> text will be the output.

==== Index of Keywords ====

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
index{name}
</syntaxhighlight>
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>,
<code>pdflatex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.

==== Capabilities of The Program <code>doconce</code> ====

The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

==== Exercises ====

DocOnce supports ''Exercise'', ''Problem'', ''Project'', and ''Example''.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain ''elements'':


<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  <li> a label (optional)
  <li> a solution file (optional)
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)
  <li> main exercise text (required)
  <li> a short answer (optional)
  <li> a full solution (optional)
  <li> one or more hints (optional)
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</syntaxhighlight>
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
</syntaxhighlight>
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

</syntaxhighlight>
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments <code>--without_answers</code> and <code>--without_solutions</code>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


==== Environments ====

DocOnce environments start with <code>!benvirname</code> and end with <code>!eenvirname</code>,
where <code>envirname</code> is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


<ul>
 <li> <code>c</code>: computer code (or verbatim text)
 <li> <code>t</code>: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 <li> <code>subex</code>: sub-exercise
 <li> <code>ans</code>: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 <li> <code>sol</code>: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 <li> <code>quote</code>: indented text
 <li> <code>notice</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>hint</code>: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 <li> <code>pop</code>: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 <li> <code>slidecell</code>: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide
</ul>

==== Preprocessing ====

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</syntaxhighlight>

With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

#summary DocOnce Quick Reference
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
By **Hans Petter Langtangen**
=== Jan 32, 2100 ===

<<TableOfContents>>



**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

//Mission.// Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code //once, in one place// and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's {{{blogger.com}}}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

== Supported Formats ==

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}})
 * HTML (format {{{html}}})
 * reStructuredText (format {{{rst}}})
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format {{{plain}}})
 * Sphinx (format {{{sphinx}}})
 * IPython notebook (format {{{ipynb}}})
 * MediaWiki (format {{{mwiki}}})
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format {{{pandoc}}})
 * Googlecode wiki (format {{{gwiki}}})
 * Creoloe wiki (format {{{cwiki}}})
 * Epydoc (format {{{epydoc}}})
 * StructuredText (format {{{st}}})

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, and {{{html}}}; and to a slightly
less extent {{{mwiki}}} and {{{pandoc}}}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


== Emacs syntax support ==

The file [[https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el|.doconce-mode.el]]
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
{{{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")}}} to the {{{.emacs}}} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:


 | =Emacs key         | =Action                                             |
 |  Ctrl+c f          |  figure                                             |
 |  Ctrl+c v          |  movie/video                                        |
 |  Ctrl+c h1         |  heading level 1 (section/h1)                       |
 |  Ctrl+c h2         |  heading level 2 (subsection/h2)                    |
 |  Ctrl+c h3         |  heading level 2 (subsection/h3)                    |
 |  Ctrl+c hp         |  heading for paragraph                              |
 |  Ctrl+c me         |  math environment: {{{!bt}}} equation {{{!et}}}     |
 |  Ctrl+c ma         |  math environment: {{{!bt}}} align {{{!et}}}        |
 |  Ctrl+c ce         |  code environment: {{{!bc}}} code {{{!ec}}}         |
 |  Ctrl+c cf         |  code from file: {{{@@@CODE}}}                      |
 |  Ctrl+c table2     |  table with 2 columns                               |
 |  Ctrl+c table3     |  table with 3 columns                               |
 |  Ctrl+c table4     |  table with 4 columns                               |
 |  Ctrl+c exer       |  exercise outline                                   |
 |  Ctrl+c slide      |  slide outline                                      |
 |  Ctrl+c help       |  print this table                                   |


== Title, Authors, and Date ==

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the {{{&}}} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword {{{and}}} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from {{{today}}} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., {{{Jan 32, 2100}}}.

The table of contents is removed by writing {{{TOC: off}}}.


== Section Types ==



 | =Section type      | =Syntax                                                  |
 |  chapter           |  {{{========= Heading ========}}} (9 {{{=}}})            |
 |  section           |  {{{======= Heading =======}}}    (7 {{{=}}})            |
 |  subsection        |  {{{===== Heading =====}}}        (5 {{{=}}})            |
 |  subsubsection     |  {{{=== Heading ===}}}            (3 {{{=}}})            |
 |  paragraph         |  {{{__Heading.__}}}               (2 {{{_}}})            |
 |  abstract          |  {{{__Abstract.__}}} Running text...                     |
 |  appendix          |  {{{======= Appendix: heading =======}}} (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  appendix          |  {{{===== Appendix: heading =====}}} (5 {{{=}}})         |
 |  exercise          |  {{{======= Exercise: heading =======}}} (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  exercise          |  {{{===== Exercise: heading =====}}} (5 {{{=}}})         |


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with {{{__Abstract.__}}} or
{{{__Summary.__}}} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more {{{=}}} signs of the next heading.

The {{{Exercise:}}} keyword kan be substituted by {{{Problem:}}} or {{{Project:}}}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

== Inline Formatting ==

Words surrounded by {{{*}}} are emphasized: {{{*emphasized words*}}} becomes
//emphasized words//. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: {{{_boldface_}}} becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text

{{{
`color{red}{two red words}`
}}}
becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.
(But colors do not work in format cwiki).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:

{{{
This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.
}}}

A forced linebreak is specified by {{{<linebreak>}}} at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:

{{{
Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
to a new and simpler equation.

[^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
$\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.

Here comes a new paragraph...
}}}

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:

{{{
This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.
}}}

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:

{{{
---------
}}}

The {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, and {{{html}}} formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: {{{---}}}. Here is an example:

{{{
The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.
}}}
This text is in the cwiki rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
//Premature optimization is the root of all evil.//--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain {{{&}}} //with space(s) on both sides//. Single upper case letters on each
side of {{{&}}}, as in {{{Texas A & M}}}, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of {{{&}}}, as in {{{Guns & Roses}}},
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after {{{&}}} will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the {{{html}}},
{{{latex}}}, and {{{pdflatex}}} formats.

Emojis, as defined in [[http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com]], can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) {{{:dizzy_face:}}} with blank or newline
before or after. Only the {{{pdflatex}}} and {{{html}}} output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
{{{--no_emoji}}} removes all emojis from the output document.

== Lists ==

There are three types of lists: //bullet lists//, where each item starts
with {{{*}}}, //enumeration lists//, where each item starts with {{{o}}} and gets
consecutive numbers,
and //description// lists, where each item starts with {{{-}}} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2,
    second line of subitem2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  ** subitem1 of item2
  //* subitem2 of item2


 // item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 ## subitem1 of item2
 ## subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

//No indentation - except in lists!// 
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.




== Comment lines ==

Lines starting with {{{#}}} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats {{{rst}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} are desired.

Comment lines starting with {{{##}}} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
{{{# #ifdef EXTRA}}} and {{{# #endif}}} around the text. The command line
option {{{-DEXTRA}}} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


== Inline comments ==

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where {{{name}}} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and {{{running text}}} is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, {{{+}}} and {{{-}}}, as well
as space. Here goes an example.

{{{
Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]
}}}
which is rendered as





The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the {{{--latex_todonotes}}}
option to {{{doconce format}}}, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
{{{todonotes}}} package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:

{{{
[add: ,]
[add: .]
[add: ;]
[del: ,]
[del: ,]
[del: .]
[del: ;]
[add: some text]
[del: some text]
[edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
[name: some text -> some replacement for text]
}}}

For example, the text

{{{
First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
$Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.
}}}
can be edited as

{{{
First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
[del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
[edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
important for the following discussion.]
}}}
which in the cwiki output format results in





To implement these edits, run

{{{
Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}

== Verbatim/Computer Code ==

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with {{{words in verbatim style}}}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between {{{!bc xxx}}} and {{{!ec}}} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification {{{xxx}}} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for {{{xxx}}} are
nothing, {{{cod}}} for a code snippet, {{{pro}}} for a complete program,
{{{sys}}} for a terminal session, {{{dat}}} for a data file (or output from a
program),
{{{Xpro}}} or {{{Xcod}}} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming {{{X}}}, where {{{X}}} may be {{{py}}} for Python,
{{{cy}}} for Cython, {{{sh}}} for Bash or other Unix shells,
{{{f}}} for Fortran, {{{c}}} for C, {{{cpp}}} for C++, {{{m}}} for MATLAB,
{{{pl}}} for Perl. For output in {{{latex}}} one can let {{{xxx}}} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the {{{ptex2tex}}} configuration file
({{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}}). For {{{sphinx}}} output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments ({{{xxx}}}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what {{{sphinx}}} applies to typeset computer code).

The {{{xxx}}} specifier has only effect for {{{latex}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):

{{{
from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi

def f(x, y, z, t):
    return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@
}}}
The {{{@@@CODE}}} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file {{{doconce_program.sh}}}.
The second line copies from the first line matching the //regular
expression// {{{doconce clean}}} up to, but not including, the line
matching the //regular expression// {{{^doconce split_rst}}}.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside {{{!bc shpro}}}
and {{{!ec}}} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become {{{!bc shcod}}} and {{{!ec}}} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension {{{.X}}}, the environment
becomes {{{!bc Xpro}}} or {{{!bc Xcod}}} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ({{{Xcod}}} and {{{Xpro}}}) are only active for
{{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, html`, and {{{sphinx}}} outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly ({{{envir=shpro}}}) such
that it indicates a complete shell program ({{{shpro}}}) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from {{{name=}}} until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to {{{!bc shcod}}}, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

== LaTeX Mathematics ==

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}},
pdflatex`, {{{pandoc}}}, and {{{mwiki}}} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
{{{Ax=b}}}. To help increase readability in other formats than {{{sphinx}}},
{{{latex}}}, and {{{pdflatex}}}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
{{{!bt}}}
and
{{{!et}}} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:

{{{
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
!et
}}}

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
Here is a single equation:

{{{
!bt
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
!et
}}}
which results in

{{{
\[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
}}}

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the {{{sphinx}}}, {{{pandoc}}},
{{{mwiki}}}, {{{html}}}, or {{{ipynb}}} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:


 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}},   and {{{ipynb}}} formats.
 * Only five equation environments can be used: {{{\[ ... \]}}},   {{{equation*}}}, {{{equation}}}, {{{align*}}}, and {{{align}}}.
 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names   {{{newcommands*.tex}}}.
 * MediaWiki ({{{mwiki}}}) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to {{{sphinx}}} and other formats such that
labels in {{{align}}} environments work well.)

//Notice.// 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure ({{{subfigure}}} package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as {{{sphinx}}} and {{{html}}}, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using {{{doconce combine_images}}}),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see //Typesetting of Algorithms// in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically {{{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}}}) to
include special code for {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
{{{.tex}}} produced by DocOnce.



//LaTeX Newcommands.//
The author can define {{{newcommand}}} statements in files with names
{{{newcommands*.tex}}}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in {{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For {{{html}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}},
{{{mwiki}}}, {{{ipynb}}}, and {{{pandoc}}}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire {{{newcommand}}} outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).


== Hyperlinks ==

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:

{{{
Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
(as in "search google": "http://google.com")
or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".

Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
"`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".

Mail addresses works too: send problems to
"`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".
}}}

== Figures and Movies ==

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note three important syntax details:


 # A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 # no comments between {{{width}}}, {{{height}}}, and {{{frac}}} and no spaces    around the {{{=}}} characters,
 # all of the command must appear on a single line,
 # there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The {{{width}}}
and {{{height}}} parameters affect HTML formats ({{{html}}}, {{{rst}}}, {{{sphinx}}}),
while {{{frac}}} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{
doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image
}}}
This command applies {{{montage}}} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in {{{html}}} and {{{sphinx}}} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is

{{{
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.

MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.

}}}
The latter results in

Vimeo movie. {{{http://vimeo.com/55562330}}}: load [[movie_player1.html|{{{movie_player1.html}}}]] into a browser


== Tables ==

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

The command-line option {{{--tables2csv}}} (to {{{doconce format}}})
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file {{{table_X.csv}}},
where {{{X}}} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.

{{{
Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt
}}}
Now we can do {{{# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"}}} in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in {{{mydata_table.do.txt}}}
into the DocOnce file.

== Labels and References ==

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose {{{name}}}
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like {{{:}}} or {{{_}}} between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label {{{name}}} is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before {{{ref}}}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


== Citations and Bibliography ==

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where {{{name}}} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have {{{name}}} on the form
{{{Author1_Author2_YYYY}}}, {{{Author_YYYY}}}, or {{{Author1_etal_YYYY}}}, where
{{{YYYY}}} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line {{{BIBFILE: papers.pub}}},
where {{{papers.pub}}} is a publication database in the
[[https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish|Publish]] format.
BibTeX {{{.bib}}} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

== Generalized References ==

There is a //generalized referencing// feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with {{{ref}}} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is

{{{
ref[internal][cite][external]
}}}
with a specific example being

{{{
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
"testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
"A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
DocOnce documents may include movies.
}}}
The output from a generalized reference is the text {{{internal}}} if all
references with {{{ref}}} in the text {{{internal}}} are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if {{{cite}}} is non-empty and the format is
{{{latex}}} or {{{pdflatex}}}, one assumes that the references in {{{internal}}}
are to external documents declared by a comment line
{{{# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc}}} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is {{{internal}}} followed by {{{cite}}},
and the
LaTeX package {{{xr}}} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
{{{external}}} text will be the output.

== Index of Keywords ==

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the {{{latex}}},
{{{pdflatex}}}, {{{rst}}}, and {{{sphinx}}} formats.

== Capabilities of The Program {{{doconce}}} ==

The {{{doconce}}} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a {{{.do.txt}}} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

== Exercises ==

DocOnce supports //Exercise//, //Problem//, //Project//, and //Example//.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain //elements//:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads

{{{
===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
}}}
the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint

!bsol
Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
!esol
!esubex

!bremarks
At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
!eremarks

!bsol
Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol

}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments {{{--without_answers}}} and {{{--without_solutions}}}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


== Environments ==

DocOnce environments start with {{{!benvirname}}} and end with {{{!eenvirname}}},
where {{{envirname}}} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:


 * {{{c}}}: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * {{{t}}}: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * {{{subex}}}: sub-exercise
 * {{{ans}}}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * {{{sol}}}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * {{{quote}}}: indented text
 * {{{notice}}}, {{{summary}}}, {{{warning}}}, {{{question}}}, {{{hint}}}: admonition boxes with    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * {{{pop}}}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * {{{slidecell}}}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a   slide

== Preprocessing ==

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either {{{preprocess}}} and/or
{{{mako}}}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The {{{mako}}} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command {{{doconce format}}} first runs {{{preprocess}}} and then {{{mako}}}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing {{{preprocess}}} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the {{{mako}}} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [[http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/|example document]] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize {{{mako}}} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the {{{doc/src/make.sh}}} script).

 * Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"



************** File: quickref.st *****************
TITLE: DocOnce Quick Reference
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory, and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo)
DATE: Jan 32, 2100
**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's 'blogger.com', Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format 'latex' and 'pdflatex')
 - HTML (format 'html')
 - reStructuredText (format 'rst')
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format 'plain')
 - Sphinx (format 'sphinx')
 - IPython notebook (format 'ipynb')
 - MediaWiki (format 'mwiki')
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format 'pandoc')
 - Googlecode wiki (format 'gwiki')
 - Creoloe wiki (format 'cwiki')
 - Epydoc (format 'epydoc')
 - StructuredText (format 'st')

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are 'latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', and 'html'; and to a slightly
less extent 'mwiki' and 'pandoc'. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

Emacs syntax support

The file "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el":.doconce-mode.el
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
'(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")' to the '.emacs' file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

=============  ======================================  
  Emacs key                    Action

Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::

        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::

        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the '&' keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword 'and' works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from 'today' if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., 'Jan 32, 2100'.

The table of contents is removed by writing 'TOC: off'.

Section Types

=============  ===========================================  
 Section type                     Syntax                    
=============  ===========================================  
chapter        '========= Heading ========' (9 '=')         
section        '======= Heading ======='    (7 '=')         
subsection     '===== Heading ====='        (5 '=')         
subsubsection  '=== Heading ==='            (3 '=')         
paragraph      '__Heading.__'               (2 '_')         
abstract       '__Abstract.__' Running text...              
appendix       '======= Appendix: heading =======' (7 '=')  
appendix       '===== Appendix: heading =====' (5 '=')      
exercise       '======= Exercise: heading =======' (7 '=')  
exercise       '===== Exercise: heading =====' (5 '=')      
=============  ===========================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with '__Abstract.__' or
'__Summary.__' at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more '=' signs of the next heading.

The 'Exercise:' keyword kan be substituted by 'Problem:' or 'Project:'.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by '*' are emphasized: '*emphasized words*' becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: '_boldface_' becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text::

        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.
(But colors do not work in format st).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes::

        This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.

A forced linebreak is specified by '<linebreak>' at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears::

        Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
        to a new and simpler equation.
        
        [^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
        $\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.
        
        Here comes a new paragraph...

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX::

        This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line::

        ---------

The 'latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', and 'html' formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: '---'. Here is an example::

        The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
        space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
        *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

This text is in the st rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain '&' *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of '&', as in 'Texas A & M', remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of '&', as in 'Guns & Roses',
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after '&' will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the 'html',
'latex', and 'pdflatex' formats.

Emojis, as defined in "http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com":http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) ':dizzy_face:' with blank or newline
before or after. Only the 'pdflatex' and 'html' output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
'--no_emoji' removes all emojis from the output document.

Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with '*', *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with 'o' and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with '-' followed
by a keyword and a colon::

        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2,
            second line of subitem2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
        shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
        right below the line above.
        
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: --  
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 keyword2: --  
   followed by text on the next line
 keyword3: --  
   and its description may fit on one line

*No indentation - except in lists!* 
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.



Comment lines

Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats 'rst' and
'sphinx' are desired.

Comment lines starting with '##' are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
'# #ifdef EXTRA' and '# #endif' around the text. The command line
option '-DEXTRA' will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.

Inline comments

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::

        [name: running text]

where 'name' is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and 'running text' is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, '+' and '-', as well
as space. Here goes an example::

        Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]

which is rendered as





The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the '--latex_todonotes'
option to 'doconce format', colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
'todonotes' package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by::

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing::

        [add: ,]
        [add: .]
        [add: ;]
        [del: ,]
        [del: ,]
        [del: .]
        [del: ;]
        [add: some text]
        [del: some text]
        [edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
        [name: some text -> some replacement for text]

For example, the text::

        First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
        $Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.

can be edited as::

        First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
        [edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]

which in the st output format results in





To implement these edits, run::

        Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt

Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::

        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with 'words in verbatim style'.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between '!bc xxx' and '!ec' directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification 'xxx' indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for 'xxx' are
nothing, 'cod' for a code snippet, 'pro' for a complete program,
'sys' for a terminal session, 'dat' for a data file (or output from a
program),
'Xpro' or 'Xcod' for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming 'X', where 'X' may be 'py' for Python,
'cy' for Cython, 'sh' for Bash or other Unix shells,
'f' for Fortran, 'c' for C, 'cpp' for C++, 'm' for MATLAB,
'pl' for Perl. For output in 'latex' one can let 'xxx' reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the 'ptex2tex' configuration file
('.ptex2tex.cfg'). For 'sphinx' output one can insert a comment::

        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments ('xxx') onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what 'sphinx' applies to typeset computer code).

The 'xxx' specifier has only effect for 'latex' and
'sphinx' output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)

Computer code can also be copied from a file::

         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The '@@@CODE' identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file 'doconce_program.sh'.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* 'doconce clean' up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* '^doconce split_rst'.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside '!bc shpro'
and '!ec' directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become '!bc shcod' and '!ec' when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension '.X', the environment
becomes '!bc Xpro' or '!bc Xcod' for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ('Xcod' and 'Xpro') are only active for
'latex', 'pdflatex', html`, and 'sphinx' outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly ('envir=shpro') such
that it indicates a complete shell program ('shpro') even if we copy a
part of the file (here from 'name=' until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to '!bc shcod', which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats 'html', 'sphinx', 'latex',
pdflatex`, 'pandoc', and 'mwiki' work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than 'sphinx',
'latex', and 'pdflatex', inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::

        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
'!bt'
and
'!et' (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::

        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et

This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::

        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the 'sphinx', 'pandoc',
'mwiki', 'html', or 'ipynb' formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 - AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the 'html', 'sphinx',
   and 'ipynb' formats.
 - Only five equation environments can be used: '\[ ... \]',
   'equation*', 'equation', 'align*', and 'align'.
 - Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   'newcommands*.tex'.
 - MediaWiki ('mwiki') does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to 'sphinx' and other formats such that
labels in 'align' environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure ('subfigure' package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as 'sphinx' and 'html', make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using 'doconce combine_images'),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically '#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")') to
include special code for 'latex' and 'pdflatex' output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
'.tex' produced by DocOnce.



*LaTeX Newcommands.*
The author can define 'newcommand' statements in files with names
'newcommands*.tex'. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that 'newcommands_keep.tex'
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in 'newcommands_replace.tex' will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For 'html', 'sphinx', 'latex', 'pdflatex',
'mwiki', 'ipynb', and 'pandoc', the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire 'newcommand' outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

Hyperlinks

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::

        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::

        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between 'width', 'height', and 'frac' and no spaces
    around the '=' characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The 'width'
and 'height' parameters affect HTML formats ('html', 'rst', 'sphinx'),
while 'frac' is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the 'latex' and 'pdflatex' formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies 'montage' or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in 'html' and 'sphinx' documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::

        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

Vimeo movie. 'http://vimeo.com/55562330': load movie_player1.html:'movie_player1.html' into a browser

Tables

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::

        
        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option '--tables2csv' (to 'doconce format')
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file 'table_X.csv',
where 'X' is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files::

        Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt

Now we can do '# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"' in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in 'mydata_table.do.txt'
into the DocOnce file.

Labels and References

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::

        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose 'name'
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like ':' or '_' between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label 'name' is written as::

        ref{name}

again with no backslash before 'ref'.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

Citations and Bibliography

Single citations are written as::

        cite{name}

where 'name' is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have 'name' on the form
'Author1_Author2_YYYY', 'Author_YYYY', or 'Author1_etal_YYYY', where
'YYYY' is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::

        cite{name1,name2,name3}

The bibliography is specified by a line 'BIBFILE: papers.pub',
where 'papers.pub' is a publication database in the
"https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish":Publish format.
BibTeX '.bib' files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized References

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with 'ref' to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::

        ref[internal][cite][external]

with a specific example being::

        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        DocOnce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text 'internal' if all
references with 'ref' in the text 'internal' are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if 'cite' is non-empty and the format is
'latex' or 'pdflatex', one assumes that the references in 'internal'
are to external documents declared by a comment line
'# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc' (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is 'internal' followed by 'cite',
and the
LaTeX package 'xr' is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
'external' text will be the output.

Index of Keywords

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::

        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the 'latex',
'pdflatex', 'rst', and 'sphinx' formats.

Capabilities of The Program 'doconce'

The 'doconce' program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a '.do.txt' file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::

        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::

        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::

        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments '--without_answers' and '--without_solutions'
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

Environments

DocOnce environments start with '!benvirname' and end with '!eenvirname',
where 'envirname' is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 - 'c': computer code (or verbatim text)
 - 't': math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 - 'subex': sub-exercise
 - 'ans': short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 - 'sol': full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 - 'quote': indented text
 - 'notice', 'summary', 'warning', 'question', 'hint': admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 - 'pop': text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 - 'slidecell': indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either 'preprocess' and/or
'mako'. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The 'mako' preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command 'doconce format' first runs 'preprocess' and then 'mako'.
Here is a typical example on utilizing 'preprocess' to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::

        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif

With the 'mako' preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/":example document contains
some illustrations on how to utilize 'mako' (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the 'doc/src/make.sh' script).

 - Excellent "Sphinx Tutorial" by C. Reller: "http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~creller/web/tricks/reST.html"

************** File: quickref.epytext *****************
TITLE: DocOnce Quick Reference
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory, and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo)
DATE: Jan 32, 2100
B{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}

I{Mission.} Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code I{once, in one place} and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's C{blogger.com}, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format C{latex} and C{pdflatex})
 - HTML (format C{html})
 - reStructuredText (format C{rst})
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format C{plain})
 - Sphinx (format C{sphinx})
 - IPython notebook (format C{ipynb})
 - MediaWiki (format C{mwiki})
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format C{pandoc})
 - Googlecode wiki (format C{gwiki})
 - Creoloe wiki (format C{cwiki})
 - Epydoc (format C{epydoc})
 - StructuredText (format C{st})

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, C{sphinx}, and C{html}; and to a slightly
less extent C{mwiki} and C{pandoc}. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file U{.doconce-mode.el<https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el>}
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
C{(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")} to the C{.emacs} file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

=============  ========================================  
  Emacs key                     Action                   
=============  ========================================

Ctrl+c table4  table with 4 columns                      
Ctrl+c exer    exercise outline                          
Ctrl+c slide   slide outline                             
Ctrl+c help    print this table                          
=============  ========================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::

        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::

        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the C{&} keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword C{and} works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from C{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., C{Jan 32, 2100}.

The table of contents is removed by writing C{TOC: off}.

Section Types
-------------

=============  =============================================  
 Section type                      Syntax                     
=============  =============================================  
chapter        C{========= Heading ========} (9 C{=})         
section        C{======= Heading =======}    (7 C{=})         
subsection     C{===== Heading =====}        (5 C{=})         
subsubsection  C{=== Heading ===}            (3 C{=})         
paragraph      C{__Heading.__}               (2 C{_})         
abstract       C{__Abstract.__} Running text...               
appendix       C{======= Appendix: heading =======} (7 C{=})  
appendix       C{===== Appendix: heading =====} (5 C{=})      
exercise       C{======= Exercise: heading =======} (7 C{=})  
exercise       C{===== Exercise: heading =====} (5 C{=})      
=============  =============================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with C{__Abstract.__} or
C{__Summary.__} at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more C{=} signs of the next heading.

The C{Exercise:} keyword kan be substituted by C{Problem:} or C{Project:}.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by C{*} are emphasized: C{*emphasized words*} becomes
I{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: C{_boldface_} becomes B{boldface}. Colored words
are also possible: the text::

        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.
(But colors do not work in format epytext).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes::

        This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.

A forced linebreak is specified by C{<linebreak>} at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX::

        This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line::

        ---------

The C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, C{sphinx}, and C{html} formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: C{---}. Here is an example::

        The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
        space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
        *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

This text is in the epytext rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
I{Premature optimization is the root of all evil.}--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain C{&} I{with space(s) on both sides}. Single upper case letters on each
side of C{&}, as in C{Texas A & M}, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of C{&}, as in C{Guns & Roses},
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after C{&} will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the C{html},
C{latex}, and C{pdflatex} formats.

Emojis, as defined in U{http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com<http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com>}, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) C{:dizzy_face:} with blank or newline
before or after. Only the C{pdflatex} and C{html} output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
C{--no_emoji} removes all emojis from the output document.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: I{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with C{*}, I{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with C{o} and gets
consecutive numbers,
and I{description} lists, where each item starts with C{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon::

        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2,
            second line of subitem2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
        shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
        right below the line above.
        
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

I{No indentation - except in lists!} 
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.



Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with C{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats C{rst} and
C{sphinx} are desired.

Comment lines starting with C{##} are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
C{# #ifdef EXTRA} and C{# #endif} around the text. The command line
option C{-DEXTRA} will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.

Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::

        [name: running text]

where C{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and C{running text} is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, C{+} and C{-}, as well
as space. Here goes an example::

        Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]

which is rendered as





The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the C{--latex_todonotes}
option to C{doconce format}, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
C{todonotes} package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by::

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing::

        [add: ,]
        [add: .]
        [add: ;]
        [del: ,]
        [del: ,]
        [del: .]
        [del: ;]
        [add: some text]
        [del: some text]
        [edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
        [name: some text -> some replacement for text]

For example, the text::

        First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
        $Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.

can be edited as::

        First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
        [edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]

which in the epytext output format results in





To implement these edits, run::

        Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::

        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with C{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between C{!bc xxx} and C{!ec} directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification C{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for C{xxx} are
nothing, C{cod} for a code snippet, C{pro} for a complete program,
C{sys} for a terminal session, C{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
C{Xpro} or C{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming C{X}, where C{X} may be C{py} for Python,
C{cy} for Cython, C{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
C{f} for Fortran, C{c} for C, C{cpp} for C++, C{m} for MATLAB,
C{pl} for Perl. For output in C{latex} one can let C{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the C{ptex2tex} configuration file
(C{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For C{sphinx} output one can insert a comment::

        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (C{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what C{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The C{xxx} specifier has only effect for C{latex} and
C{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)

Computer code can also be copied from a file::

         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The C{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file C{doconce_program.sh}.
The second line copies from the first line matching the I{regular
expression} C{doconce clean} up to, but not including, the line
matching the I{regular expression} C{^doconce split_rst}.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside C{!bc shpro}
and C{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become C{!bc shcod} and C{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension C{.X}, the environment
becomes C{!bc Xpro} or C{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (C{Xcod} and C{Xpro}) are only active for
C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, html`, and C{sphinx} outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (C{envir=shpro}) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (C{shpro}) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from C{name=} until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to C{!bc shcod}, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats C{html}, C{sphinx}, C{latex},
pdflatex`, C{pandoc}, and C{mwiki} work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
M{Ax=b}. To help increase readability in other formats than C{sphinx},
C{latex}, and C{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
C{!bt}
and
C{!et} (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

Here is a single equation::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

which results in::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the C{sphinx}, C{pandoc},
C{mwiki}, C{html}, or C{ipynb} formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 - AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the C{html}, C{sphinx},
   and C{ipynb} formats.
 - Only five equation environments can be used: C{\[ ... \]},
   C{equation*}, C{equation}, C{align*}, and C{align}.
 - Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   C{newcommands*.tex}.
 - MediaWiki (C{mwiki}) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to C{sphinx} and other formats such that
labels in C{align} environments work well.)

I{Notice.} 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (C{subfigure} package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as C{sphinx} and C{html}, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using C{doconce combine_images}),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see I{Typesetting of Algorithms} in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically C{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
include special code for C{latex} and C{pdflatex} output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
C{.tex} produced by DocOnce.



I{LaTeX Newcommands.}
The author can define C{newcommand} statements in files with names
C{newcommands*.tex}. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that C{newcommands_keep.tex}
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in C{newcommands_replace.tex} will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For C{html}, C{sphinx}, C{latex}, C{pdflatex},
C{mwiki}, C{ipynb}, and C{pandoc}, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire C{newcommand} outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::

        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::

        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between C{width}, C{height}, and C{frac} and no spaces
    around the C{=} characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The C{width}
and C{height} parameters affect HTML formats (C{html}, C{rst}, C{sphinx}),
while C{frac} is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the C{latex} and C{pdflatex} formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies C{montage} or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in C{html} and C{sphinx} documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::

        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

Vimeo movie. C{http://vimeo.com/55562330}: load U{C{movie_player1.html}<movie_player1.html>} into a browser

Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::

        
        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option C{--tables2csv} (to C{doconce format})
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file C{table_X.csv},
where C{X} is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files::

        Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt

Now we can do C{# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"} in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in C{mydata_table.do.txt}
into the DocOnce file.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::

        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose C{name}
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like C{:} or C{_} between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label C{name} is written as::

        ref{name}

again with no backslash before C{ref}.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::

        cite{name}

where C{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have C{name} on the form
C{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, C{Author_YYYY}, or C{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
C{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::

        cite{name1,name2,name3}

The bibliography is specified by a line C{BIBFILE: papers.pub},
where C{papers.pub} is a publication database in the
U{Publish<https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish>} format.
BibTeX C{.bib} files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized References
----------------------

There is a I{generalized referencing} feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with C{ref} to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::

        ref[internal][cite][external]

with a specific example being::

        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        DocOnce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text C{internal} if all
references with C{ref} in the text C{internal} are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if C{cite} is non-empty and the format is
C{latex} or C{pdflatex}, one assumes that the references in C{internal}
are to external documents declared by a comment line
C{# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc} (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is C{internal} followed by C{cite},
and the
LaTeX package C{xr} is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
C{external} text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::

        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the C{latex},
C{pdflatex}, C{rst}, and C{sphinx} formats.

Capabilities of The Program C{doconce}
--------------------------------------

The C{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a C{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

        DocOnce version 1.0.3

Exercises
---------

DocOnce supports I{Exercise}, I{Problem}, I{Project}, and I{Example}.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain I{elements}:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::

        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::

        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::

        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments C{--without_answers} and C{--without_solutions}
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

Environments
------------

DocOnce environments start with C{!benvirname} and end with C{!eenvirname},
where C{envirname} is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 - C{c}: computer code (or verbatim text)
 - C{t}: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 - C{subex}: sub-exercise
 - C{ans}: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 - C{sol}: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 - C{quote}: indented text
 - C{notice}, C{summary}, C{warning}, C{question}, C{hint}: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 - C{pop}: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 - C{slidecell}: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either C{preprocess} and/or
C{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The C{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command C{doconce format} first runs C{preprocess} and then C{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing C{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::

            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.

With the C{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An U{example document<http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize C{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the C{doc/src/make.sh} script).

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's blogger.com, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

Supported Formats
-----------------

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format latex and pdflatex)

 * HTML (format html)

 * reStructuredText (format rst)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format plain)

 * Sphinx (format sphinx)

 * IPython notebook (format ipynb)

 * MediaWiki (format mwiki)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format pandoc)

 * Googlecode wiki (format gwiki)

 * Creoloe wiki (format cwiki)

 * Epydoc (format epydoc)

 * StructuredText (format st)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are latex, pdflatex, sphinx, and html; and to a slightly
less extent mwiki and pandoc. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.

Emacs syntax support
--------------------

The file .doconce-mode.el (https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el)
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el") to the .emacs file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

=============  ==================================  
  Emacs key                  Action                
=============  ==================================

Ctrl+c h1      heading level 1 (section/h1)        
Ctrl+c h2      heading level 2 (subsection/h2)

Ctrl+c help    print this table                    
=============  ==================================  

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::

        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::

        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the & keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword and works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from today if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., Jan 32, 2100.

The table of contents is removed by writing TOC: off.

Section Types
-------------

=============  =======================================  
 Section type                   Syntax                  
=============  =======================================  
chapter        ========= Heading ======== (9 =)         
section        ======= Heading =======    (7 =)         
subsection     ===== Heading =====        (5 =)         
subsubsection  === Heading ===            (3 =)         
paragraph      __Heading.__               (2 _)         
abstract       __Abstract.__ Running text...            
appendix       ======= Appendix: heading ======= (7 =)  
appendix       ===== Appendix: heading ===== (5 =)      
exercise       ======= Exercise: heading ======= (7 =)  
exercise       ===== Exercise: heading ===== (5 =)      
=============  =======================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with __Abstract.__ or
*Summary.* at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more = signs of the next heading.

The Exercise: keyword kan be substituted by Problem: or Project:.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by * are emphasized: *emphasized words* becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: _boldface_ becomes _boldface_. Colored words
are also possible: the text::

        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes two red words.
(But colors do not work in format plain).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes::

        This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.

A forced linebreak is specified by <linebreak> at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears::

        Differentiating[^diff2] (ref{eq1}) leads
        to a new and simpler equation.
        
        [^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
        $\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.
        
        Here comes a new paragraph...

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX::

        This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line::

        ---------

The latex, pdflatex, sphinx, and html formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: ---. Here is an example::

        The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
        space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
        *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

This text is in the plain rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain & *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of &, as in Texas A & M, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of &, as in Guns & Roses,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after & will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the html,
latex, and pdflatex formats.

Emojis, as defined in http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) :dizzy_face: with blank or newline
before or after. Only the pdflatex and html output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
--no_emoji removes all emojis from the output document.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with *, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with o and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with - followed
by a keyword and a colon::

        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2,
            second line of subitem2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
        shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
        right below the line above.
        
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2

 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line


No indentation - except in lists! ----------------------------|
|                                                             |
| DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.                  |
| No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists. |
| Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|


Comment lines
-------------

Lines starting with # are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats rst and
sphinx are desired.

Comment lines starting with ## are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
# #ifdef EXTRA and # #endif around the text. The command line
option -DEXTRA will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.

Inline comments
---------------

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax::

        [name: running text]

where name is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and running text is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, + and -, as well
as space. Here goes an example::

        Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]

which is rendered as

        Some running text. [hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]


The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the --latex_todonotes
option to doconce format, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
todonotes package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running::

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by::

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing::

        [add: ,]
        [add: .]
        [add: ;]
        [del: ,]
        [del: ,]
        [del: .]
        [del: ;]
        [add: some text]
        [del: some text]
        [edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
        [name: some text -> some replacement for text]

For example, the text::

        First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
        $Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.

can be edited as::

        First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
        [edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]

which in the plain output format results in

        First[add 2: ,] consider [edit 3: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del 4: Q. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] Q>0. There are three[del 5: ,] fundamental[del 6: , basic]
        [edit 7: property -> properties] of Q. [add 8: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]


To implement these edits, run::

        Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::

        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with words in verbatim style.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between !bc xxx and !ec directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification xxx indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for xxx are
nothing, cod for a code snippet, pro for a complete program,
sys for a terminal session, dat for a data file (or output from a
program),
Xpro or Xcod for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming X, where X may be py for Python,
cy for Cython, sh for Bash or other Unix shells,
f for Fortran, c for C, cpp for C++, m for MATLAB,
pl for Perl. For output in latex one can let xxx reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ptex2tex configuration file
(.ptex2tex.cfg). For sphinx output one can insert a comment::

        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (xxx) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what sphinx applies to typeset computer code).

The xxx specifier has only effect for latex and
sphinx output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax)::

        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)

Computer code can also be copied from a file::

         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The @@@CODE identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file doconce_program.sh.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* doconce clean up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* ^doconce split_rst.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside !bc shpro
and !ec directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become !bc shcod and !ec when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension .X, the environment
becomes !bc Xpro or !bc Xcod for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (Xcod and Xpro) are only active for
latex, pdflatex, html`, and sphinx outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (envir=shpro) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (shpro) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from name= until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to !bc shcod, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats html, sphinx, latex,
pdflatex`, pandoc, and mwiki work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than sphinx,
latex, and pdflatex, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::

        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
  !bt
and
  !et (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line::

        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et

This LaTeX code gets rendered as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}

Here is a single equation::

        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in::

        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the sphinx, pandoc,
mwiki, html, or ipynb formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the html, sphinx,
   and ipynb formats.

 * Only five equation environments can be used: \[ ... \],
   equation*, equation, align*, and align.

 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   newcommands*.tex.

 * MediaWiki (mwiki) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to sphinx and other formats such that
labels in align environments work well.)


Notice ------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                              |
| LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple               |
| plots in the same figure (subfigure package), margin notes, multi-page       |
| tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.   |
| Other output formats, such as sphinx and html, make it necessary for DocOnce |
| to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer              |
| must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than           |
| one plot per figure (combine them into one using doconce combine_images),    |
| example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),              |
| algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce      |
| manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions    |
| instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention      |
| some.                                                                        |
|                                                                              |
| However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on                                |
| the format (typically #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")) to                |
| include special code for latex and pdflatex output and more                  |
| straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can          |
| also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting          |
| PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the            |
| .tex produced by DocOnce.                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


*LaTeX Newcommands.*
The author can define newcommand statements in files with names
newcommands*.tex. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that newcommands_keep.tex
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in newcommands_replace.tex will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For html, sphinx, latex, pdflatex,
mwiki, ipynb, and pandoc, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire newcommand outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).

Hyperlinks
----------

Links use either a link text or the raw URL::

        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::

        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,

 2. no comments between width, height, and frac and no spaces
    around the = characters,

 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,

 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The width
and height parameters affect HTML formats (html, rst, sphinx),
while frac is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the latex and pdflatex formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the::

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies montage or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in html and sphinx documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is::

        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in

Vimeo movie. http://vimeo.com/55562330: load movie_player1.html (movie_player1.html) into a browser

Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::

        
        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option --tables2csv (to doconce format)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file table_X.csv,
where X is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files::

        Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt

Now we can do # #include "mydata_table.do.txt" in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in mydata_table.do.txt
into the DocOnce file.

Labels and References
---------------------

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::

        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose name
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like : or _ between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label name is written as::

        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ref.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.

Citations and Bibliography
--------------------------

Single citations are written as::

        cite{name}

where name is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have name on the form
Author1_Author2_YYYY, Author_YYYY, or Author1_etal_YYYY, where
YYYY is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::

        cite{name1,name2,name3}

The bibliography is specified by a line BIBFILE: papers.pub,
where papers.pub is a publication database in the
Publish (https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish) format.
BibTeX .bib files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

Generalized References
----------------------

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with ref to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is::

        ref[internal][cite][external]

with a specific example being::

        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        DocOnce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text internal if all
references with ref in the text internal are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format is
latex or pdflatex, one assumes that the references in internal
are to external documents declared by a comment line
# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is internal followed by cite,
and the
LaTeX package xr is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
external text will be the output.

Index of Keywords
-----------------

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::

        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the latex,
pdflatex, rst, and sphinx formats.

Capabilities of The Program doconce

The doconce program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a .do.txt file to some format. Here is the

Exercises
---------

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::

        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads::

        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::

        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments --without_answers and --without_solutions
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.

Environments
------------

DocOnce environments start with !benvirname and end with !eenvirname,
where envirname is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * c: computer code (or verbatim text)

 * t: math blocks with LaTeX syntax

 * subex: sub-exercise

 * ans: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise

 * sol: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise

 * quote: indented text

 * notice, summary, warning, question, hint: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color

 * pop: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations

 * slidecell: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

Preprocessing
-------------

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either preprocess and/or
mako. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The mako preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command doconce format first runs preprocess and then mako.
Here is a typical example on utilizing preprocess to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::

        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif

With the mako preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An example document (http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize mako (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the doc/src/make.sh script).

# DocOnce Quick Reference
### Author

**Hans Petter Langtangen** at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
#### Date: Jan 32, 2100
<!-- Table of contents: Run pandoc with --toc option -->



**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

*Mission.* Enable writing documentation with much mathematics and
computer code *once, in one place* and include it in traditional LaTeX
books, thesis, and reports, and without extra efforts also make
professionally looking web versions with Sphinx or HTML. Other outlets
include Google's `blogger.com`, Wikipedia/Wikibooks, IPython
notebooks, plus a wide variety of formats for documents without
mathematics and code.

### Supported Formats

DocOnce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * IPython notebook (format `ipynb`)
 * MediaWiki (format `mwiki`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

For documents with much code and mathematics, the best (and most supported)
formats are `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html`; and to a slightly
less extent `mwiki` and `pandoc`. The HTML format supports blog posts on
Google and Wordpress.


### Emacs syntax support

The file [.doconce-mode.el](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/blob/master/misc/.doconce-mode.el)
in the DocOnce source distribution gives a "DocOnce Editing Mode" in
Emacs. Store the raw version of the file in the home directory and add
`(load-file "~/.doconce-mode.el")` to the `.emacs` file.

Besides syntax highlighting of DocOnce documents, this Emacs mode
provides a lot of shortcuts for setting up many elements in a document:

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center">  Emacs key  </th> <th align="center">                Action                </th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c f         </td> <td align="left">   figure                                    </td> </tr>

<tr><td align="left">   Ctrl+c h3        </td> <td align="left">   heading level 2 (subsection/h3)           </td> </tr>

### Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 & institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the `&` keyword
separates the institutions (the keyword `and` works too).
Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Jan 32, 2100`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


### Section Types
<div id="quick:sections"></div>

<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th align="center"> Section type</th> <th align="center">                   Syntax                  </th> </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter          </td> <td align="left">   <code>========= Heading ========</code> (9 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section          </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Heading =======</code>    (7 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection       </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Heading =====</code>        (5 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection    </td> <td align="left">   <code>=== Heading ===</code>            (3 <code>=</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph        </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Heading.__</code>               (2 <code>_</code>)           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract         </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Abstract.__</code> Running text...                </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix         </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Appendix: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   appendix         </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Appendix: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise         </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Exercise: heading =======</code> (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   exercise         </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Exercise: heading =====</code> (5 <code>=</code>)        </td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` or
`__Summary.__` at the beginning of a line and ending with three or
more `=` signs of the next heading.

The `Exercise:` keyword kan be substituted by `Problem:` or `Project:`.
A recommended convention is that an exercise is tied to the text,
a problem can stand on its own, and a project is a comprehensive
problem.

### Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` becomes **boldface**. Colored words
are also possible: the text


        `color{red}{two red words}`

becomes <font color="red">two red words</font>.
(But colors do not work in format pandoc).

Quotations appear inside double backticks and double single quotes:


        This is a sentence with ``words to be quoted''.

A forced linebreak is specified by `<linebreak>` at the point where the
linebreak in the output is wanted.

Footnotes use a label in the text with the footnote text separate,
preferably after the paragraph where the footnote appears:


        Differentiating[^diff2] \eqref{eq1} leads
        to a new and simpler equation.
        
        [^diff2]: More precisely, we apply the divergence
        $\nabla\cdot$ on both sides.
        
        Here comes a new paragraph...

Non-breaking space is inserted using the tilde character as in LaTeX:


        This distance corresponds to 7.5~km, which is traveled in $7.5/5$~s.

A horizontal rule for separating content vertically, like this:

-----

is typeset as four or more hyphens on a single line:


        ---------

The `latex`, `pdflatex`, `sphinx`, and `html` formats support em-dash,
indicated by three hyphens: `---`. Here is an example:


        The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
        space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
        *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

This text is in the pandoc rendered as

The em-dash is used - without spaces - as alternative to hyphen with
space around in sentences---this way, or in quotes:
*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*--- Donald Knuth.

An ampersand, as in Guns & Roses or Texas A&M, is written as a
plain `&` *with space(s) on both sides*. Single upper case letters on each
side of `&`, as in `Texas A & M`, remove the spaces and result in
Texas A&M, while words on both sides of `&`, as in `Guns & Roses`,
preserve the spaces: Guns & Roses. Failing to have spaces before and
after `&` will result in wrong typesetting of the ampersand in the `html`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex` formats.

Emojis, as defined in <http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com>, can be
inserted in the text, as (e.g.) `:dizzy_face:` with blank or newline
before or after. Only the `pdflatex` and `html` output formats translate
emoji specifications to images, while all other formats leave the
textual specification in the document. The command-line option
`--no_emoji` removes all emojis from the output document.

### Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consecutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2,
            second line of subitem2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
        shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
        right below the line above.
        
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2

 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks as
shown: bullets must exactly match and continuation lines must start
right below the line above.

Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1:
  :    
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 keyword2:
  :    
   followed by text on the next line
 keyword3:
  :    
   and its description may fit on one line

*No indentation - except in lists!* 
DocOnce syntax is sensitive to whitespace.
No lines should be indented, only lines belonging to lists.
Indented lines may give strange output in some formats.




### Comment lines

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

Comment lines starting with `##` are not propagated to the output
document and can be used for comments that are only of interest in
the DocOnce file.

Large portions of text can be left out using Preprocess. Just place
`# #ifdef EXTRA` and `# #endif` around the text. The command line
option `-DEXTRA` will bring the text alive again.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the DocOnce source file that will be removed by Mako before
DocOnce starts processing the file.


### Inline comments

Inline comments meant as messages or notes, to authors during development
in particular,
are enabled by the syntax

        [name: running text]

where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. The name can contain upper and lower
case characters, digits, single quote, `+` and `-`, as well
as space. Here goes an example.


        Some running text. [hpl: There must be a space after the colon,
        but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]

which is rendered as

> Some running text. [hpl 1: There must be a space after the colon,
> but the running text can occupy multiple lines.]



The inline comments have simple typesetting in most formats, typically
boldface name, a comment number, with everything surrounded by
parenthesis.  However, with LaTeX output and the `--latex_todonotes`
option to `doconce format`, colorful margin or inline boxes (using the
`todonotes` package) make it very easy to spot the comments.

Running

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to authors during the development of the document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the DocOnce source by

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

Inline comments can also be used to markup edits. There are add, delete, and
replacement comments for editing:


        [add: ,]
        [add: .]
        [add: ;]
        [del: ,]
        [del: ,]
        [del: .]
        [del: ;]
        [add: some text]
        [del: some text]
        [edit: some text -> some replacement for text]
        [name: some text -> some replacement for text]

For example, the text


        First consider a quantity $Q$. Without loss of generality, we assume
        $Q>0$. There are three, fundamental, basic property of $Q$.

can be edited as


        First[add: ,] consider [edit: a quantity -> the flux]
        [del: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
        we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del: ,] fundamental[del: , basic]
        [edit: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add: These are not
        important for the following discussion.]

which in the pandoc output format results in

> First[add 2: ,] consider [edit 3: a quantity -> the flux]
> [del 4: $Q$. Without loss of generality,
> we assume] $Q>0$. There are three[del 5: ,] fundamental[del 6: , basic]
> [edit 7: property -> properties] of $Q$. [add 8: These are not
> important for the following discussion.]



To implement these edits, run


        Terminal> doconce apply_edit_comments mydoc.do.txt

### Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives, which must appear on the
beginning of the line. A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment

        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Here is an example of computer code (see the source of this document
for exact syntax):


        from numpy import sin, cos, exp, pi
        
        def f(x, y, z, t):
            return exp(-t)*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(2*pi*z)

<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, indent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:

         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  envir=shpro fromto: name=@

The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first line copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second line copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including, the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third line behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (this construction often
used for copying text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied lines from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active for
`latex`, `pdflatex`, html`, and `sphinx` outout.  The fourth line
above specifies the code environment explicitly (`envir=shpro`) such
that it indicates a complete shell program (`shpro`) even if we copy a
part of the file (here from `name=` until the end of the file).
Copying a part will by default lead to `!bc shcod`, which indicates a
code snippet that normally needs more code to run properly.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

### LaTeX Mathematics

DocOnce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`,
pdflatex`, `pandoc`, and `mwiki` work with this syntax while all other
formats will just display the raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` (begin/end TeX) directives starting on the beginning of a line:


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
        \end{align*}
        !et

This LaTeX code gets rendered as

$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot \pmb{u} &= 0,\\ 
\nabla\times \pmb{u} &= 0.
\end{align*}
$$
Here is a single equation:


        !bt
        \[ \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.\]
        !et

which results in

$$
 \frac{\partial\pmb{u}}{\partial t} + \pmb{u}\cdot\nabla\pmb{u} = 0.
$$

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
`mwiki`, `html`, or `ipynb` formats
is also important, one should follow these rules:

 * AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the `html`, `sphinx`,
   and `ipynb` formats.
 * Only five equation environments can be used: `\[ ... \]`,
   `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, and `align`.
 * Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
   the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
   `newcommands*.tex`.
 * MediaWiki (`mwiki`) does not support references to equations.

(DocOnce performs extensions to `sphinx` and other formats such that
labels in `align` environments work well.)

*Notice.* 
LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
plots in the same figure (`subfigure` package), margin notes, multi-page
tables, example and algorithm environments, code listings in figures, etc.
Other output formats, such as `sphinx` and `html`, make it necessary for DocOnce
to only utilze very standard LaTeX. Correspondingly, the writer
must stick to simple constructs and avoid, for instance, more than
one plot per figure (combine them into one using `doconce combine_images`),
example environments (use subsection or subsubsection instead),
algorithms environments (see *Typesetting of Algorithms* in the DocOnce
manual), newcommands outside mathematics (use Mako variables or functions
instead), code listings in figures (use just inline blocks), to mention
some.

However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of the resulting
PDF document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
`.tex` produced by DocOnce.



*LaTeX Newcommands.*
The author can define `newcommand` statements in files with names
`newcommands*.tex`. Such commands should only be used for mathematics
(other LaTeX constructions are only understood by LaTeX itself).
The convention is that `newcommands_keep.tex`
contains the newcommands that are kept in the document, while
those in `newcommands_replace.tex` will be replaced by their full
LaTeX code. This conventions helps make readable documents in formats
without LaTeX support. For `html`, `sphinx`, `latex`, `pdflatex`,
`mwiki`, `ipynb`, and `pandoc`, the mathematics in newcommands is
rendered nicely anyway. If you desire `newcommand` outside LaTeX
mathematics, simply use a Mako variable or a Mako function (which
will be much more flexible and powerful).


### Hyperlinks

Links use either a link text or the raw URL:


        Here is some "some link text": "http://some.net/address"
        (as in "search google": "http://google.com")
        or just the raw address: URL: "http://google.com".
        
        Links to files typeset in verbatim mode applies backtics:
        "`myfile.py`": "http://some.net/some/place/myfile.py".
        
        Mail addresses works too: send problems to
        "`hpl@simula.no`": "mailto:hpl@simula.no"
        or just "send mail": "mailto:hpl@simula.no".

### Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500 frac=0.8] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}
        

Note three important syntax details:

 1. A mandatory comma after the figure/movie filename,
 2. no comments between `width`, `height`, and `frac` and no spaces
    around the `=` characters,
 3. all of the command must appear on a single line,
 4. there must be a blank line after the command.

The figure file can be listed without extension. DocOnce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, DocOnce will convert
another format to the needed one.

The caption is optional. If omitted, the figure will be inlined (meaning
no use of any figure environment in HTML or LaTeX formats). The `width`
and `height` parameters affect HTML formats (`html`, `rst`, `sphinx`),
while `frac` is the width of the image as a fraction of the total text
width in the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the

        doconce combine_images image1 image2 ... output_image

This command applies `montage` or PDF-based tools to combine the images
to get the highest quality.

YouTube and Vimeo movies will be embedded in `html` and `sphinx` documents
and otherwise be represented by a link. The syntax is


        MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] YouTube movie.
        
        MOVIE: [http://vimeo.com/55562330, width=500 height=278] Vimeo movie.
        

The latter results in


<iframe width="500" height="278" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/55562330" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<em>Vimeo movie.</em>




### Tables

The table in the section [Section Types](#quick:sections) was written with this
syntax:

        
        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|
        

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There must be a blank line before and after the table.
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

The command-line option `--tables2csv` (to `doconce format`)
makes DocOnce dump each table to CSV format in a file `table_X.csv`,
where `X` is the table number. This feature makes it easy to
load tables into spreadsheet programs for further analysis.

DocOnce tables can be efficiently made directly from data in CSV files.


        Terminal> doconce csv2table mydata.csv > mydata_table.do.txt

Now we can do `# #include "mydata_table.do.txt"` in the DocOnce
source file or simply copy the table in `mydata_table.do.txt`
into the DocOnce file.

### Labels and References

The notion of labels and references (as well as bibliography and index)
is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

        \label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword. It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, using a delimiter like `:` or `_` between
(e.g.) section, subsection, and topic.

A reference to the label `name` is written as

        ref{name}

again with no backslash before `ref`.

Use labels for sections and equations only, and preceed the reference
by "Section" or "Chapter", or in case of an equation, surround the
reference by parenthesis.


### Citations and Bibliography

Single citations are written as

        cite{name}

where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

        cite{name1,name2,name3}

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: papers.pub`,
where `papers.pub` is a publication database in the
[Publish](https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish) format.
BibTeX `.bib` files can easily be combined to a Publish database
(which DocOnce needs to create bibliographies in other formats
than LaTeX).

### Generalized References

There is a *generalized referencing* feature in DocOnce that allows
a reference with `ref` to have one formulation if the label is
in the same document and another formulation if the reference is
to an item in an external document. This construction makes it easy
to work with many small, independent documents in parallel with
a book assembly of some of the small elements.
The syntax of a generalized reference is


        ref[internal][cite][external]

with a specific example being


        As explained in
        ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in cite{testdoc:12}][a "section":
        "testdoc.html#___sec2" in the document
        "A Document for Testing DocOnce": "testdoc.html" cite{testdoc:12}],
        DocOnce documents may include movies.

The output from a generalized reference is the text `internal` if all
references with `ref` in the text `internal` are references to labels
defined in the
present document. Otherwise, if `cite` is non-empty and the format is
`latex` or `pdflatex`, one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line
`# Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal` followed by `cite`,
and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external
documents.  If none of the two situations above applies, the
`external` text will be the output.

### Index of Keywords

DocOnce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.

### Capabilities of The Program `doconce`

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

### Exercises

DocOnce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, *Project*, and *Example*.
These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
Exercise, problem, project, or example sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:",
    "Project:", or "Example:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        \label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

If the exercise type (Exercise, Problem, Project, or Example)
is enclosed in braces, the type is left out of the title in the
output. For example, the if the title line above reads


        ===== {Problem}: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====

the title becomes just "Derive the ...".

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        \label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        
        !bsol
        Here goes the solution of this subexercise.
        !esol
        !esubex
        
        !bremarks
        At the very end of the exercise it may be appropriate to summarize
        and give some perspectives. The text inside the `!bremarks` and `!eremarks`
        directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.
        !eremarks
        
        !bsol
        Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
        !esol
        

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.
The command-line arguments `--without_answers` and `--without_solutions`
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.


### Environments

DocOnce environments start with `!benvirname` and end with `!eenvirname`,
where `envirname` is the name of the environment. Here is a listing of
the environments:

 * `c`: computer code (or verbatim text)
 * `t`: math blocks with LaTeX syntax
 * `subex`: sub-exercise
 * `ans`: short answer to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `sol`: full solution to exercise or sub-exercise
 * `quote`: indented text
 * `notice`, `summary`, `warning`, `question`, `hint`: admonition boxes with
    custom title, special icon, and (frequently) background color
 * `pop`: text to gradually pop up in slide presentations
 * `slidecell`: indication of cells in a grid layout for elements on a
   slide

### Preprocessing

DocOnce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... \label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\ 
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\ 
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\ 
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\ 
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [example document](http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the DocOnce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

Making sphinx-testdoc
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.1]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/n) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-testdoc/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-testdoc/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir-math
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/n) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir-math/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir-math/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/n) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: 
Creating file tmp_admon/conf.py.
Creating file tmp_admon/index.rst.
Creating file tmp_admon/Makefile.
Creating file tmp_admon/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file tmp_admon/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.2.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/n) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
